       "4  Nice pub & definitely a Pub as opposed to a bar. Went in December & they had LIVE Christmas music playing quietly in the background. Had Fried Clam Strips - they were good & the serving was huge - almost entree size.  Had haddock & veggies - both were very tasty & while the Haddock was a generous portion the veggies were relatively small but that is the ONLY issue I had with the food.  The service was polite, prompt & cheerful.  I will return.   \n",

       "4  Although Mr. Morris goes into minute and somtimes mundane details of TR's life, I was never bored. Mr. Morris had, of course one on the most extrodinary characters in our history to work with. TR amazed his  contemporaries &amp; still captivates us a century later. He is a giant  &amp; it's very obvious how far we &amp; our leaders today have fallen from  his standards.  Morris does not cheerlead for TR. But recounting his early  life points the direction that even the people of his own time...   \n",
       "5  If you play poker for money, you need to get this book.  A clearer guide to poker success does not exist. In my opinion, it is better than Harrington's Volume II which is its closest rival.What makes it better are the extremely detailed post-flop hand analysis.  Post-flop is where most of the money is won or lost, it is the hardest part to learn, and, not lending itself to a hand and position \"re-raise, raise, call, fold\" chart, it is the most difficult to teach.Rather than just codify a lis...   \n",
       "6  This is not just a bad book.  It is a sick one.Bloom's obsessions are clear on almost every page:  sex and rock music.  Although clothed in a pretentious philosophical language, his objections betray what's really on his mind: he feels left out.  The sexual revolution of the Sixties passed him by, and like the child whose playmates decide he's not good enough to get into the game, he retaliates by labelling everything about his opponents evil.The poet Philip Larkin had Bloom's number when he...   \n",

       "0  I wish I could give this book 5 stars, because the main thesis it presents (global cooling for at least the next few decades) looks right, and the main response (thorium nuclear power) looks right. That said, Archibald loses credibility with his political views, especially that the global warming myth is promulgated by the UN in attempt to take over, or at least control, world food production. That is one of the more inane conspiracy theories around. It would require a degree of UN unanimity...   \n",

Carson's popular book titled \"Showing the Spirit (A Theological Exposition of 1 Corinthians 12-14)\" several years ago and waited with great anticipation for the opportune time to finally read this book on one of the most controversial subjects in the church today. My first observation about this study was the unusual book title. Carson doesn't let the reader in on this point until nearly the end of the book. This book was published twenty-five years ago in 1987, back when some ...   \n",

       "3  1984 by George Orwell is a great book, but Brave New World by Huxley has captured the sad spirit of todays world. Some elements such as flying cars are either non existent or in infancy stages, but the central ideas are alive and well in America. With a world that appears to be growing more violent by the day, more Americans are looking for a place to escape--- a utopia. With the media saturation with images of sex, it's almost like children are indocternated with the idea of sexual play fro...   \n",
       "4  Laurie Notaro has outdone herself this time.  Always interesting and always hilarious, she has raised her dryly offbeat humorous look at life to a new level with this book.  Telling a good short story is a fading part of the American literary experience, and she, and the others that still practice the art of big ideas with few words, should be followed carefully and encouraged, lest they be lured away from their craft into the glitzy (and, no doubt more profitable) world of creating dull, as...   \n",
       "5  After listening to Pastor McConnell's testimony several months ago and seeing his autobiography for three bucks, I dropped the Washingtons for this incredible account of how the Father radically tranforms people's lives. Is There Anybody Out There? is not your typical Christian story, and there is very little reference to God in the first half of the book. Pastor McConnell had an extremely troubling upbringing that led to a life behind bars yet God got a hold of Him and changed him forever. ...   \n",
       "6  \"The Autobiography of Mark Twain,\" Volume I, has been worth the wait.  In spite of the 200+ pages of Introductory material, the Twain writings are excellent.  Hemingway claimed he was the best American writer, and I think he was correct.  I've read a great deal of literature over the years, but I don't believe there is another American writer with the range of emotions, the wit, the unbelievable insight into the human condition that Twain demonstrates over and over.  His life was filled with...   \n",
       "7  This is an authentic historical record of how the horses changed the lives of Natives living on the plains of America.  The horses came from runaway from explorers and tribal interaction. It is interesting how the horses and the Indians both were examples of survival of the fittest. They went from subsistence hunter gatherers to more efficient yet more respectful of nature societies. From having to drive a herd over a cliff when they were on foot to selecting individuals as their prey made f...   \n",
       "8  I spent 4 years studying Latin in high school in the 1970s and loved it, as did my brother and sister. We took Latin because our mother had loved it in the 1940s. I'm a big fan of Hanson and I knew this was largely a book for those in academia, but the authors mount a stirring defense of the teaching of the classics in general and how the field might still be saved.Their advice for university scholars and mentors in the field is equally relevant to professors of the humanities now that colle...   \n",
       "9  This is the first book I read by Burroughs, so I think that I had a bit of an advantage on other people who had read his previous work.  I tend to stay away from memoirs to begin with.  To me they are generally pretty boring and the authors usually end up sounding like either great whiners or petty bores.  And some of the details that Burroughs writes about in this book may saddle him with that same tag, but the emotions that he is able to dredge up outshine any confessions that struck me as...   \n",

We stayed after the private event and enjoyed a bottle of wine and other appetizers.  The DJ music was perfect for the atmosphere.  I can imagine picking up this place and setting it down in multiple cities across the country.   \n",

       "1  Best Gas prices around except for of course it's competitor Costco which also has great prices. But with that being said - it's always cheaper to gas up @ sams club compared to any other corporately owned gas station. You will easily save 10- 20 cents per gallon. Additionally this sams club gas station also has a automatic car wash which is very affordable! Great product very good price comparatively and usually there is a kinda weird/creepy attendant around if you need help or have any ques...   \n",

       "3         Actually not bad of a place as it is with most thrift store the variety and the availability is really changing. So you can get lucky or not. If you are grossed out by places like 'village des valeurs' and renaissances. It's a great place for you since all the good stuff is already skimmed out. In fact there is a few stores like this one almost neighbouring each other so if you want the full experience. Look around on Saint-Laurent. But to my taste it's a bit lacking this 'thrifty feel'.   \n",

Enjoys all the little shops it might be a bit hot during summer time but with the misters going on you'll be just fine. This mall sits on a very busy major intersections at 24th St. & Camelback Rd.

Yet here it is Timeless Guitars railing against the Guitar Centaur defiant in the face of the mindless mewling masses and their meandering march to internet mass-merch. What a glorious store.

I am not a would be soldier of fortune or someone pretending to be a Seal or Green Beret so the name does not impress me. F.Y.I- I was caught in a very bad draft from 1967-1969. Maybe some shooters are just watching too many Rambo or Police/Action movies? That could explain some of the silly actions witnessed at any shooting range. For months...   \n",

I think the staff at this place were trained by Bernie Madoff or something because I got a full-on professional fleece job at this place. I needed an oil change before I headed out to DC so I took my car here because I've had good experiences with the NTB in Westlake.

I learned a lot of valuable things about how a bra should fit bra types like contoured vs. seamed vs. demi and the good & bad about each.

All sort of little gadets that you really don't need but you want them anyways. Prices are really cheap and new stuff brought out all day long. Items for your yard all kinds of tools and hardware holiday decorations and polo shirts and t- shirts. Lots of fun hunting thru boxes and time really fly's fast.    \n",

All sort of little gadets that you really don't need but you want them anyways. Prices are really cheap and new stuff brought out all day long. Items for your yard all kinds of tools and hardware holiday decorations and polo shirts and t- shirts. Lots of fun hunting thru boxes and time really fly's fast.    \n",

I didn't tell them I knew anything about cars when I brought mine in to get fixed cause I wanted to see if they would be strait forward and honest with me or try to sell me a bunch of BS I don't need. They were 100% honest about the problem and the price was really good. I'm happy I brought my car here.    \n",

To be honest there was only one choice. But 2 choices in color of the fabric. But it was fine for our backyard. Got a love seat 2 club chairs a coffee table and 2 chaise lounges plus some kind of table. Can't wait for summer. Now I hope the quality is good for the money we spent.

Now that the word is out about the place being finished it is always packed and finding a parking space can be a chore. I just don't understand why it took Giant Eagle so long to turn this location into a Market District. They are headquartered in the Fox Chapel/ O'hara Township area after all. It's set up pretty much just like the somewhat larger Robin...   \n",

They were really expensive (more than 12th fret) and he sold me the wrong pots. I knew I needed 1meg pots and he sold me 500k pots and said they would be fine then they only offered me half back for them (I just kept them I'll put them in something else).

At great personal expense to my own waistline and bank account, I forced myself to eat at each of the three restaurants and then render an opinion for the benefit of my fellow Yelpsters. The restaurants under consideration were The Hungry Greek, Little Greek and Pappas Market Cafe. I've already written reviews for Pappas and Little Greek, and so ...   \n",

       "6  Corner Pub Midtown, or \"CP2\" as we like to call it (because of it's sister bar, the original Corner Pub in Green Hills) is a great place to meet after work for happy hour, to watch any sporting event, or just to go for a great hot turkey sandwich.  \\n\\nIt's not a stuffy, ultra smoky bar--windows all around, and when the weather is nice they open them fully so it's like the entire bar is a patio.  Multiple TVs so anywhere you sit has a good view.  Large, non-cramped bar.  Cold beer.  Acoustic...   \n",

Not too crowded, not too noisy, although there was a particular party with a crying baby.\\n\\nYour typical TdB outing - salad bar, sides, rolls, plates and plates of meat.

       "8  Calle Tepa is a refreshing central Tucson stop for not-your-standard Mexican fare. I certainly hope this place sticks around, as it occupies the same location as several former short-term ventures (across from the Park Place Mall). \\n The restaurant is tastefully decorated with wall murals. Eating locations include the back bar area, a patio that receives a good mix of afternoon sun and shade, and a family dining area in the front lit with natural light.\\n Now for the FOOD:\\nThis is like fan...   \n",
       "9  This hidden establishment has had a somewhat checkered past, but no more- it's owned by \"Southern Fresh\"- also of Safety Harbor, the place that is hard to get a table in on a Friday night.  And although off to a sleepy start, the off-the-beaten-path beauty of a Safety Harbor evening found a buddy and me desiring a quaff or two of cold beer and snarling down some of the best guacamole I've had in awhile.
