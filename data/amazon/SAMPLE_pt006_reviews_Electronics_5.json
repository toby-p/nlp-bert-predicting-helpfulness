The more I used the docked TF701, the more disappointed I was with both dock and tablet. It is fast, faster than my old Windows 7 laptop, but I was eventually dealing with crashes as well as the dock not responding and at one time it quit working altogether. Some tech savvy folk have returned their dock more than 5 times only to get another lemon. I was specifically looking at the TF701/dock as a laptop replacement for Windows, but most people who had replaced their Windows laptops with Android told me: \"Go get a Galaxy Note.\" I didn't want to go down that road because Samsung seems to be dominating the Android hardware market. I felt we needed a more level playing field as there was during the old PC-era with Dell, HP, Compaq, and the other companies which built hardware for Windows. I tried an $850 Windows 8 substitute for my old Windows 7 laptop, but it was rife with so many issues that I finally decided to stick with Android and eventually caved in and bought the Galaxy Tab 12.2 with the Zagg keyboard/dock (yes, I looked at the iPad as well and realized this was not a point in my life for re-entering the Mac-world). Boy, was I surprised...What a machine! Samsung has nailed the first generation of windowing on Android (and we can all hope there will be many generations to follow), the SM-P900 brings up a very complex Excel spreadsheet in less than 5 seconds (one which took my old Windows laptop nearly a minute to open), and it is just overall a phenomenal experience to use this, well, what can I call it? I feel like something from the future which has fortuitously landed in my hands . You can write on the screen and then send the notes to email or wherever and so far the translation has been nearly always right. The capabilities just go on and on...it is a laptop replacement and much, much more. This product showcases why Samsung dominates Android hardware, though their software wrap on their tablet is a lot of bloat-ware stuff which just gets in the way; because of that and the fact that the new leader of Android at Google has disabled external SD-access in Kitkat 4.4.2, I had to root it, as it looks like all of us will with any device which has an SD card in the future which we want to use as a disc drive unless standard access to external SD memory is reinstated, but rooting was an easy 15 minute process in my case (though one which voided the tablet's warranty if not unrooted before making a claim). I installed the Nova launcher as well.  Anyway, all said, when I look up from interacting with this Galaxy 12.2 Tab while writing this review by speaking/handwriting/and a bit of typing, I fully expected to see myself floating between solar systems in an advanced anti-gravity machine which is destined to take everyone who understands the power of the machine on an unprecedented adventure...it's the type of advance which makes one feel that way.

Keep in mind that this is a high end tablet meant for one who wants a very high screen resolution and has excellent specs on a WiFi only tablet. The performance I found peppy, the screen is just amazing in clarity and readability! And I love the new Kit Kat. First I list the PROS, which are wonderful, however, I give this 4.5 stars because there are some Cons that I want you to consider BEFORE you decide to purchase this or not...PROS/SPECIAL FEATURES ON THE TAB PRO 10.1:+ Screen Resolution/Weight/Size etc - The first thing I noticed is that side by side the screen spec are so so much better on this then previous Tab 2 and Tab 3. This model has a resolution of 2560 x 1600 (with 299 PPI-Pixels per inch) vs the older Tab 2 10.1 and Tab 3 10.1 had 800x1280 (with 149 PPI-Pixels per inch). Therefore, this model has DOUBLE the resolution of the older TAB line! Result: It is that much clearer and vivid screen with truly amazing clarity.+ Speed/Extra Memory - To check out how fast my apps opened and websites etc, I placed my Tab Pro next to my older Tab 2 and my Tab 3 8.0, the Pro was faster to load websites, faster to open apps etc. The memory in the Pro is 2GB of RAM vs the Tab 2 and 3 in the 10.1 the RAM is 1GB (it is 1.5GB on the Tab 3 8.0). So I am finding that this extra memory has made a difference in speed in my opinion.+ Speed of this unit / Memory etc (and special testing of speed) - This tablet has more memory and is MUCH faster than my other tablets. So I performed a tests today using my: Tab Pro 10.1, Tab 3 8.0 and Tab 2 10.1 (all WiFi only tablets. Results: I found that my Tab Pro 10.1 runs faster than my older Tab 2 10.1 does (with 4.2.2). **To better gauge the speed, I opened the same apps, etc using this tablet, Tab 3 8.0 and Tab 2 10.1 - This one opened apps, webpages and more so much faster than my other tablets!+ Ability to turn off the apps I did not want (helped my battery life). Did an actual test today to see if this made a difference and it did. After I safely turned off the apps that are safe to turn off, I now have more free memory and my battery life per hour has increased. So I documented this. If you have any questions about this, please ask in the comment section. Just a little tweak like this can really make a difference in battery lasting longer and better control over the memory etc.+ WiFi Connecting/Speed of WiFi and MORE - This tablet connects very quickly to my home WiFi and has never ever dropped the WIFi signal no matter where I am in my home. WiFi is OK in this device and does work very well, however, it is not as strong of a WiFi signal as SOME my other WiFi devices that I own presently. When I move closer to the router, it shows 4.5 to 5 bars, which is very good to excellent.*** To test the speed and strength of this WiFi and compare it to my other Android devices, I went to the Playstore and got the free app called WiFi Analyzer. This is a MUST HAVE app for any Android device as it gives you a visual report on the WiFi strength of your tablet, phone etc.****Do you need to know how to get on the internet when you are out of a WiFi range? Ask me about this as I have written an article on how to do this using a MiFi type of service from different service providers (please ask in the comment section for more info).+ SPECIAL INFO about INTERNET CONNECTION - Yes, this is a WiFi only, but when you are away from an WiFi internet hotspot location, there are ways to can get onto the internet such as MiFi and there are ways that you can purchase equipment so that you can have data when you do not have a WiFi hotspot available.+ Internet & Webpage & Video Viewing - The stock browser does a great job, however, I use Maxthon Browser and installed archived flash so I have great internet flash video viewing results and it renders webpages quite fast for me. And I suggest the free app called Pocket from the Playstore so you can read internet articles later offline.+ EXTERNAL SLOT FOR MICRO SD CARD up to 64GB - This is no real change over the Tab 3 line, but still it is a must for me as I keep my personal files, photos, and music on my internal SD card. Note that this was one of the deciding factors that sold me on this tablet.+ Camera / Video Camera - The front camera is now 8MP which is much better than then older Tab 2 and Tab 3 lines. And I took pictures inside and outside and they came out very SHARP and VERY CLEAR! So I am impressed with the camera!And I took some videos inside and outside to test this and they are much clearer and better resolution than on my Tab 2 tablet.+ Home Videos - The stock video player is OK and plays MOST home videos, however, may I suggest QQ Player (Free App from Playstore and the ONLY one I recommend as it plays every home video I tried).+ Reading/Creating/Editing Word, Excel, Text Files and much more on this tablet: This comes with a So So Office app (viewer) for reading Office documents, however, I STILL prefer Kingsoft Office which is a free app from Playstore. It is the best I have ever tried and I am very picky about so called Office programs. It is very compatible with MS Office as it reads, edits and creates Office files and reads PDF files, and it has more features of any other Android Office program that I tried. This app is a MUST have for tablet owners in my opinion.+ Music Player/Sound Quality - Stock player has clear sound through the outside \"speakers\" and very clear using headphones. To sync easily with Windows Media Player may I suggest the Playstore app free) WinAmp for the tablet as it is very highly rated and the sound is good, but I use a very high quality Bluetooth speaker for great sound! Suggestions: The best way to really enjoy music is through a high quality Bluetooth speaker or Bluetooth headset as the sound quality is superb this way and you can walk about your home listening to your music!+ Battery Life- Since I have done a few tweaks on this tablet, now I have found that my battery life is better than the first and even the second day. In fact, the battery life now I find that when I use WiFi just when I need it, I now get about 6 to 8 hours with it(this reflects 100 percent brightness however). Still this is better than I received on my older Tab 2, so I am happy.***Where battery life is concerned: To make your battery last as long as possible is to be sure to turn off BLUETOOTH AND WIFI when you do not need these. Both are these are memory hogs! Also, I turn off my GPS and even SYNC sometimes to conserve battery and then turn them on later.+ OTG USB Compatible - You can add an optional OTG (On the Go adapter cable to the Micro port for copying files to your flash drive and from your flash drive to the Tab Pro). You can also plug in a mouse, I tried it and it worked. *Note that portable external hard drives and portable DVD/CD drives will not work using OTG in the Tab Pro because these both require a lot of power to be compatible with the Tab Pro and most tablets that have the OTG. However, it is still good to know that you can easily plug in your flash drive and copy files to the Tab Pro and from Tab Pro to PC--what a time-saver. I have written an article on OTG and how to use it, just request this in the comments.+ Bluetooth Speed and Performance - The Bluetooth keyboard I own (generic OKA) paired quickly with several devices and copied files at a great rate of speed. Speaking of Bluetooth: Also there will be Bluetooth keyboards out for the Tab Pro coming soon. (Just make sure you purchase one for JUST THE TAB Pro 10.1 size).+ Lighter Weight - This is very light and easy to carry, the weigh is just about the same as iPad Air.CONS:- No support for Flash Videos - Adobe does not support flash any longer in any brand of Android tablet these days. This non support is for all Android tablets, not just Samsung tablets. Even if downloaded, the archived Adobe Flash is very outdated for any Android tablet with an OS of 4.2 or higher, it is really just too old and sluggish and difficult to make it work.I use Playstore apps as YouTube, Netflix, CBS.COM and more and open up the app instead of going to the browser to watch videos that I want to. They play fine in an APP rather than in a Browser.******* Need a tablet with 3G/Phone and Data that cost less than the Pro? There is the Tab 3 10.1 with 3G and a phone and data in it the P5200 model in white or brown. The P5200 Tab 3 10.1 is 90 dollars less than this Pro and you can make phone calls with it, use your data plan as it accepts an activated GSM Micro Sim card.

However, in my opinion, the wait is over for all of those who have been on the fence, waiting for Google to announce a new tablet.This device is, in my opinion, the next Android tablet that beats the others. It is, on initial evaluation, without any current equal.On start up it immediately goes into settings which take only a minute to complete. I am a Google user, so I entered my account and it downloaded all of my apps that I have installed on my other Google accounts.I also use a Microsoft exchange e-mail. It installed, downloaded my contacts and calendar.I am a user of the Nexus 7, and a Samsung Note 3 cell phone. So, I am very familiar and happy with the Android/Samsung environment.This device is absolutely flawless and present. Great screen, incredible clarity, and the touch screen responds as quickly as the Nexus 7.The new interface is somewhat different, but I actual like the fact that when I open it, it shows me my calendar, e-mails and the news. It can be changed to include more or less.I have used the Nexus for almost 6 months, wishing there was a larger device with up to date hardware and software. Well, this device is fast and handles every app and function without a hiccup. It has never hesitated or had a slow response rate. No freezes or any complaints. The touchscreen has an instant response. There is no evidence of any response problem.I did install the new Hancom and my first impression are good. Microsoft documents opened without a hitch.I was not able to get the free Bloomberg download to download. Not certain if the server is overwhelmed as it comes from the Samsung site.It also comes with free inflight GOGO for one year, which I will use... and hulu, which I could live without. Sirius radio for three months if you don't already have a subscription.The WIFI seems very good. I was able to connect throughout my area without any loss of signal or drops.The weight and size is almost identical to the IPAD air, Easy to hold and use.So, easy setup, new but nice touchwiz interface, good WIFI, light as the IPAD Air but with Android and it looks great.I did consider that this does not have the  S pen. However, this device is lighter than the 10.1 Note, and the typewriter on the screen is &#34;THE BEST&#34; I have ever used. Great touch and feel.

It has a nice feel and it runs smoothly depending on what you do with yours. I use mine while waiting  - I ride with people sometimes and read and I sit in the bed and want to lounge - and thought it worked really well for that. I do have to say that I was really surprised by how thick it was when I first got it, then even more surprised by how well it handled considering how thick the item is. There's a light-weight quality to it that allowed me to use it easily, tilting it this way and that while goofing off - I mean testing it. I suppose that's what Lite means.I want to also note that I'm tech-savvy enough to utilize an item, but I'm not going to quote specifications. There are other reviewers doing that and they seem really knowledgeable, so they're a better option for that. I tried the item out and tested it in the real world, using it at the doctor or during breaks or on the go, if that helps any.I played a lot of applications for trial and the tablet ran smoothly, not having some of the hiccups I've noticed in other items when it comes to smaller games. There were a few issues when it came to some of the larger games I've purchased, with the requirements making me pause as it lagged it certain spots. I could adjust settings and control the issues, but there was still so lag. Playback on videos online was nice and movies played great as well, never once having an issue. To me this was a big plus. I also read comics on my tablets, and while a 7 &#34; screen is not the most optimal setup for it, the tablet does a great job with fill and with colors. That's always been an issue for me when using something like a Kindle - perhaps it has been fixed by now, but there was always a framing issue that bothered me. With this, no framing. You can always zoom on frames if so inclined to make up for a smaller screen, which I do with this one. I read a book on it while goofing off; the read went well as expected, which I didn't really doubt. Android readers have always done right by me.  Online use is good, no problems noted, with everything from directions to the restaurant to looking up random trivial working out.Other reviewers have mentioned the price, and that is one issue the tablet has going against it. It will get cheaper as time goes on, so while it is an issue while writing this, it won't be for long. Another thing is the 8 GB internal memory, but with the ability to connect a mini-SD to almost every device these days, it wasn't too much for me to consider for myself but something I felt worth noting.  I'm not a video-chatter so the lack of one camera does not bother me.

Dent \"Aragorn\"", "helpful": [4, 6], "reviewText": "Before I purposely 'forget' that this is 'a Bose' while discussing the SoundLink, I will state that anyone expecting some amazing simulated 'deep surround' out of this device is likely to be disappointed. The sound is great and it better be at this price but the SoundLink is not built on the Bose Wave technology and therefore do not expect simulated home theater quality sound to fill up your room. This is meant to be a portable device.Now, discussing the SoundLink while in a brand-blind mode, I happen to like its clear and reasonably loud output, the long battery life and its pairing easily with just about everything Bluetooth out there. Setup is easy and playback makes me into a happy listener. Can't get much better for a portable speaker.On the 'not so impressive' side of the evaluation coin, the SoundLink is more heavy than I expected for something that's meant to be portable, the narrow base makes it likely that it's going to fall on its back or on its face from time to time and I hope that one didn't have to pay extra to buy a cover which may be needed if you really, really want to take your speaker out on a trip and want some protection for those times when it falls on its back or on its face.In the end, it's the sound that matters most and the sound is good, almost too good for something 'outdoors'. The SoundLink covers the entire range from bass to acutes well and I couldn't detect much distortion unless the volume was all the way up. As good as the sound is, there's very little stereo separation which is Okay for something meant to be portable but worth considering nevertheless.

Now that Bose offers recent releases in the ultraportable in addition to portable category the decision of what speaker to buy has become even more difficult then choosing between the large list of competing companies. I will try my best to help others make an easier decision to avoid spending way too much money on speakers as I have.BUILD and STYLE:Bose is the Apple of Bluetooth speakers. Their designs offer a minimalist, yet refined quality and their latest addition continues this trend just in a different form factor. The craftsmanship is stellar with its wraparound metal grill, nearly matching the Soundlink Mini and exceeding the Soundlink II which has painted plastic for its sides and edges . Despite the different form factor, the size of the Soundlink III is nearly the same as the Soundlink II, which is small enough to be an easy travel companion. Sure the Soundlink Mini is smaller, but really not so much where it makes notable difference when taking on the go. The most obvious omission from the first 2 generations of the speaker is the folding grill cover. Many might find this to be a bigger omission than it actually is. While the folding cover protected the metal grill, the more prone to dings plastic edges and corners are left exposed. That is how I found out the sides are plastic on the Soundlink II and never even realized I had bumped it into anything. The cover that you can purchase for the Soundlink III is similar to the Soundlink Mini's offering superior protection by covering the areas that are most prone to abuse. Style is purely subjective and I find the design quite appealing while not standing out above the Soundlink or my favorite speaker for outdoors, the all metal UE BoomBox. My vote for the best aesthetic design would be for the Soundlink Mini.FEATURES:Bose takes no shame in harnessing all of its efforts toward speaker performance. Features include only those required of speaker operation allowing easy volume adjustment and Bluetooth pairing. Since Bose did not include speakerphone capability for its ultracompact model, it comes with no surprise this one omits that feature as well. Also missing from the Bose lineup that some competitors offer are track and bass/treble controls. There are people who appreciate those features, but I find them useless since they will be controlled from the media player by virtually everyone. One standout feature does exist for the Soundlink Mini and that is its charging plate. It may sound trivial, but the ability to just drop the speaker on the charger rather than dealing with the plug has been a great added convenience and would have liked to have had included with the Soundlink III. As with all Bose speakers, the one feature I would have appreciated seeing would be illuminated control buttons.PERFORMANCE:Sound is obviously the most vital function of the speaker that serves to justify the price of this speaker over the competitors, its sibling or an upgrade from its predecessor. Having never listened to the first Soundlink, the Soundlink II amazed me with its sound quality, particularly the low end such a small speaker was able to put out despite somewhat drowning out the highs and mids when listened to at low to mid volumes. With the release of the MIni once again I was astonished the quality of sound that an even smaller speaker was capable of. The Soundlink II plays louder and Deeper than the Mini, but the Mini holds its own while appealing to a wider audience with more of a neutral sound offering decent bass and brighter midrange. As expected, the Soundlink III is the best sounding of the three, but not standing out so much where it offered that initial wow factor. The Soundlink III combines the deeper bass of the Soundlink II with the brighter midrange of the Mini appealing to a broader audience.  The digital sound processor of all these speakers hits the brakes on the bass when listening toward the top of the volume range, but the Soundlink III plays considerably louder than the Mini and slightly yet noticeably louder than the Soundlink II before the low end drops off.  The biggest upgrade on paper of the Soundlink III is its 14 hours battery life. This will certainly be of value to some, but I rarely have I had the need to plug in either the Mini or Soundlink II and have had each play next to the bed overnight on low volume without ever running out of juice.CONCLUSION:The addition of the Soundlink Mini in Bose's lineup was a bit of a surprise to me because of how small and portable the already existing Soundlink II was. Although not as loud as its bigger brothers, the Mini is the biggest marvel by the bass and volume generated from such a diminutive package. That being said, the Soundlink III really is small enough to be just as portable and capable of filling larger areas with music. Which of the two is a better purchase relative to price depends mostly on where you plan to use it. The Soundlink Mini is quite capable of filling a small to medium sized room such as a bedroom or bathroom with music packing some oomph, but the waves don't carry enough for larger areas such as family rooms or outdoors, particularly the lower range. Whereas, the Soundlink III is well suited for small to large rooms like family rooms and basement and does well outdoors, although I still use the UE Boombox outside as it has even deeper bass necessary to keep the low end that has the most difficult time carrying in wide open spaces.  So, if bathroom or nightstand listening is your primary purpose then the MIni would be a better option to save $100, but if you want something that is a little more versatile then the Soundlink III is well worth the extra $100. If you have the Soundlink II it probably is not worth spending the $300 to upgrade unless you absolutely have to have the latest and greatest (I'm guilty), really desire a fuller sound range or find yourself listening to music frequently without an outlet for long durations.

Here is my thoughts:1. Appearance:SoundLink 3 has a old-timer classic look. The silver part of the box is paint sprayed mesh. the black parts around have a fine texture on it. The top is soft rubber. The whole thing feels like a old radio (in a good way) with a modern touch. I personally like it better than the jawbone box or UE style, which is way too future-ish young-kids looking. SoundLink 3 is also pretty heavy. Won't be a good choice to carry around. All in all, very solid build.SoundLine Mini reminds me the Iphone. It is a whole piece of Aluminum, as least looks like it. Also heavy for its size. but much more portable.2. Sound quality:Low Volume: SoundLink3 sounds better than SoundLink2 hands down. When played at same low volume, soundLink3 is MUCH better than soundLink2 in my opinion. The sound is much more clear, vocal really stands out. the high pitch is better, but still not quite there. The mini actually sounds the best at low volume. SoundLink 3 has a \"deeper/wider/thicker\" sound than the mini, but some how the mini sounds more \"clear\" at low volume and my ear find it very pleasing.When I say low volume, I mean put it on my office desk. close the door and listen to it when working.High Volume: SoundLink 3 can get really loud. I can not bear how loud it gets when I crank it up. but I never liked loud music so keep that in mind.  For my life, I will never need that much noise. But you may want it. when turn the volume up, SoundLink 3 start to sounds better than the Mini. I am impressed it can go quite loud without much distortion. I am not saying mini is not loud. To me, Mini is good enough for my medium size room, I don't even need to turn it up that much for it starts to feel too loud. I don't know why I would ever need SoundLink 3's loud volume. Unless I want to throw a pool party.Base: The base on the Mini is just amazing. I still can not believe how such a small thing can pump out that much base. Very good. The main complain I have about UE boom box and Jawbone is they do have better high but the base is just lacking. But that again is a personal preference. My friend loves his UE box and complains every time when he hear my mini saying \"too much base no high.\" But I like the base a lot, the music is \"fuller\". My opinion, UE & Jawbone sounds tin-can-ish. I don't want that much high with no base. But again \"sound better\" is your feeling, so listen to them and make your own decision.SoundLink 3 has good base, too. also it can maintain a clear layer of sound with that base. the base is not as heavy flavored as the mini. At low volume, I think mini has a more noticeable base. At high volume, soundLink 3 start to catch up.Conclusion:1. If you like full base like me, go for Bose, if you likes high pitch better UE boom may be better. it is cheaper than Mini, and has a microphone you can make call, also has a cool app. I totally don't care about those. I want better sound for music.2. For bose, SoundLink 3 can get much louder than Mini and it sounds better at high volume. If you want loud music so your office mate next door can go complain to the boss, chose soundLink3. If you only need to fill a medium office/living room with clear music, go for mini.3. don't forget mini is 100 less than SoundLink 3. For me, if I can only keep one, I will keep the mini, it is good for all my needs. But I will keep both, I may start a party in the hall way, you never know.--Update--One more thing:Do you know that the Bluetooth devices you use to connect to those speaker make a difference? I used Samsung Note phone, Iphone, Ipad & Kindle HDX to test the same song on SoundLink3, they actually sounds different form each device. Which is very strange. Isn't this suppose to be digital? Anyway, They are obviously different to me. The best sound actually comes from my Kindle HDX, Ipad and Iphone are OK, Samsung note sounds the worst. So if you have more than one bluetooth device, try pair them all and find out if they really sound different or I am just crazy.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Sound link 3 & Mini", "unixReviewTime": 1392076800, "reviewTime": "02 11, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A1G650TTTHEAL5", "asin": "B00HWT8I24", "reviewerName": "Charles Spanky \"Zumina Reviews\"", "helpful": [5, 5], "reviewText": "Headphones have always been very popular, but recently, with the creation of Bluetooth, or a method to wirelessly transmit data, several manufacturers are producing Bluetooth headphones. Soundbot is one of these manufacturers, producing headphones like the SB270, a headset capable of wirelessly streaming music or hands-free talking.&#9654; Package Contents&#8226; SoundBot SB270&#8226; Micro USB&#8226; Male to Male Stereo Audio Cable&#8226; Instruction Manual&#9654; AccessoriesIncluded with this device is a micro USB and male to male stereo audio cable. The micro USB cable is thick but short, being 24 inches. I like that this device uses the micro USB interface, as it is the most common Android charging cable. Most Android users own micro USB cables, since it has become a standard for charging mobile devices, external batteries, and several other devices. This also includes a flat 47.5 inch male to male stereo audio cable, with gold plated connectors. The top of the cord is colored white, and the bottom of the cord is colored black. It is overall a very appealing cable.&#9654; Specifications&#8226; Music play time: 14 hours&#8226; Talk time: 12 hours&#8226; Operating range: up to 33 feet&#8226; Bluetooth standard: Bluetooth 3.0 + EDR version with AVRCP and A2DP support for hands-free talking and music streaming.&#8226; Speaker: 40mm driver speaker x 2&#8226; Charging port: 5-pin Micro USB&#8226; Minimum Charging voltage and current: 5V 200mAh&#9654; HardwareThe headphones look deceptively large on the description page, but they are much smaller (6.5 x 5 inches closed; 6.5 x 7.5 inches open). The device can come in a gray/white or black/red color scheme, where the major color would be on the headphone padding and headband, and the minor color on the headphone cover and where the headphones fold. It is overall a very sleek looking. On the left headphone casing is the power (or multifunctional) button, micro USB port (for charging), LED indicator, auxiliary port, microphone, and Volume Up and Down button.LED Indicator:&#8226; Power On: 3 Rapid blinks in blue light&#8226; Power off: 3 rapid blinks in red light&#8226; Standby: Blue light blinks once every 5 seconds&#8226; Incoming Call: Blue light blinks continuously.&#8226; In use: Blue light blinks once every 5 seconds.&#8226; Charging Mode: Red light stays on or blinks&#8226; Fully charged: Red light will turn off&#8226; Low battery alarm: Red light blinks once every 30 seconds.On the right headphone casing is the SoundBot logo. The earphones are able to be bended and closed inside the headphones, giving the most portable position possible. The earphones are also able to be flipped out, giving you the ability to hear your music while it is resting on your neck. I have absolutely no problems with the hardware of these headphones except the earpads. The earphone padding puts me in mind whenever I want to buy a new pillow. The pillow will always be fluffy when you purchase it, but as time goes, so does the pillow; this starts an endless cycle of buying more pillows. Beside the padding and being deceptively large on the Amazon profile link, I consider this the all in one package.&#9654; SetupPairing this device is fairly simple.1. Press and hold the multifunction (power) button for 7 seconds until blue and red light blink alternatively.2. Search for SB270 headset from media player device.3. Congratulations, you have successfully paired the unit.&#9654; TestingI tested this unit over the time of 3 days, or 7 hours, testing it with my Nexus 7 (2013). As stated in hardware, the padding is essentially my biggest issue with this device. During my tests, it seemed like the fluffy padding became stiffer. I assume with continual use, this will lead to uncomfortable earpads, but during the test, the earpads were very comfortable. I felt no irritation from my ears after extended use. I turned on the device by holding the power button for 3 seconds, waiting for the blue LED to blink. The headphones would automatically connect, assuming I already paired the device. I then tested this with several genres, including: rap, country, popular, rock, alternative rock, classic and rock. The sound was very clear, without any distortions, but bass was flat for low, mid, and high end. The sound quality didn&#8217;t differ from directly connecting to the stereo connector or Bluetooth. I did attempt to listen to the music on my neck with the earpads out, and found it mildly comfortable when I didn&#8217;t want to have sound blasting into my ears, but it should be noted that this is in no way replacement for speakers. The sound would be loud enough in my backyard, but in traffic. Also, it should be noted when I initially tested, the previous, next, and play/pause button would automatically change my Music tracks without being pressed, but this problem stopped after about an hour. I also never figured where the &#8220;NFC&#8221; tag on the headphones were, as the packaging claims it is compatible, but doesn&#8217;t indicate how.&#9654; Final ThoughtsIf you are transitioning from cheaper headphones to this, then you should be very happy, but if you are transitioning from high end stereo headphones, then you will clearly notice the differences. This is definitely a good stocking stuffer for your kids or budget friendly audiophiles. Because of the build quality, I only give this product a 4 star rating, but I still recommend this device to anyone needing Bluetooth headphones. If SoundBot produced a better earpad then I would consider giving a better rating.Pros:+ A budget friendly and portable Bluetooth headset, giving the ability to stream music clearly, while taking the least amount of space.+ Several media buttons for adjusting volume, powering, or answering a call.+ Easy setup and uses micro USB interface; a very common cable.Cons:- Earpads were very soft, but in time will become flat and uncomfortable.- Bass was very flat for low, mid, and high range.

We can now watch TV again without listening to our daughters ipad games.I spent a lot of time searching for wireless headphones that were actually made for kids. I came across these and thought I would give them a try.First I have to say the Company owners are 100% behind their product! If you have any questions they will answer them very quickly! They are also very nice!First Impressions:Getting the package, you are presented with a clear plastic package that is easy to open and protects the headphones nicely. The charging cable and audio link cable is not cheep feeling and the pouch is a very nice addition as well.The headphones look and feel like a quality product. The fabric used is nice, and the construction feels good.When setting them up, I tried them on and they fit me kind of. I listened to them for a bit to see what they sound like. The sound is little flat but that's what you want for a younger kid. You don't want to blow their ear drums out with bass and you don't want to fry their ear drums with a huge amount of highs. They are great for watching videos and listening to music.As far as volume limiting which was my main concern, according to the owners they are limited to 100db.Keep in mind:Jet take-off (at 25 meters) is 150db = Eardrum rupture.Jet take-off (at 305 meters), use of outboard motor, power lawn mower, motorcycle, farm tractor, jackhammer, garbage truck.  Boeing 707 or DC-8 aircraft at one nautical mile (6080 ft) before landing (106 dB); jet flyover at 1000 feet (103 dB); Bell J-2A helicopter at 100 ft (100 dB). = 100 8 times as loud as 70 dB.  Serious damage possible in 8 hr exposure.I would also note that with the other &#34;volume limiting&#34; headphones you kid will probobly throw them off their head if your trying to watch tv and they are doing their thing on their device.My suggestion is if your using an IOS device is search for volume sanity. When this app is running and key word &#34;running&#34; it will not allow the volume to be turned up to the limit set.Yes IOS devices have a volume limit in the music options but this is for wired headsets and does not work using BT headsets.After using these for about a month, my family loves them.

Lee \"spamination\"", "helpful": [5, 6], "reviewText": "Let's get one thing quickly out of the way.  This is a 2.1 sound bar and will not best a true 5.1 speaker set up, but we understand that when we buy a sound bar.  Sound bars are valuable to a home theater set up because they don't require cables to be run all through your viewing room.  People who want better sound than their TVs provide but don't want the extraneous cabling are the ones who buy sound bars.  That being said, this Yamaha is a very good, if not great, product.There are many ~$100 sound bars which have flooded the market in the last couple of years, but most of those are nothing more than glorified powered monitors like you'd find on a cheap pair of computer speakers.  These products are generally all about form over function and provide very little to no benefits beyond a decent built-in TV speaker.  LG I'm looking at you!First off, Yamaha is a storied brand in the home theater market.  Yamaha receivers and digital sound field processing has been the benchmark of mid-range audio systems since the first dolby pro-logic systems were introduced in the late 80s to early 90s.  Yamaha's natural sound integrated amplifiers are still some of the most highly regarded mid-ranged products in the audiophile market.  Although not necessarily known for their speakers, Yamaha speakers have quietly (figuratively of course) pleased many an audiophile.  So the pedigree is definitely there for Yamaha to do what they do in this relatively young sound bar market.Does Yamaha succeed?  Is it worth the premium over its cheaper competition?  Ultimately, how do they sound?  For movie viewing, the surround sound effect is not nearly as good as a true 5.1 system, but is a definite improvement over TV speakers and cheaper sound bars.  There was a handful of times that sound was thrown to the side and rear properly, but this effect wasn't consistent enough for me to say it is a rousing success.  The sound is definitely mid-range-centric.  The highs are present, but are a tad muted.  They lack the glass shattering clarity, but that is to be expected in this price range.  The most impressive thing for me was the bass.  Although many sound bars claim to be 2.1 systems, they rarely deliver true bass, especially sub-bass.  The YAS-103 delivers true bass.  It isn't going to shake you off the bed, but it is enough so that you will feel it.  The bass also does a great job of filling in the gaps, resulting a much fuller sound.  For music, these are very good, not great.  If you stream music using a roku, smart tv, plex client, or apple TV, then you will be happy.  I'm a bit of an audio snob that spends a lot of money on high-end headphones and speaker systems, so I tend to be overly critical here.  Considering the cost and the form factor, I give these a resounding thumbs up in terms of music playback.  Similar to my experience during movie playback, it was the highs that bothered me the most during music playback.  Just not enough sparkle in the highs for me, but perfectly decent for general listening.Features are a real benefit of the YAS-103.  First, they have a RF-relay built in.  The RF receptor in the front of the soundbar will receive the RF signals from your other remotes and an array of RF transmitters in the back will repeat these signals to devices located behind the sound bar.  This is useful if the RF sensor on your TV is blocked by the sound bar.  Your TV remote will still work with this nice pass-through feature.  On the back of the sound bar are a couple of screw mounts that will allow you to hang this speaker on the wall.  A remote control is included with just the bare necessities like volume and source input selection.  Yes I said it, this unit has the ability to handle multiple inputs.  There are two optical in, a coaxial in and an RCA in.  Instead of relying on your TV to be the hub of your system like most other soundbars, which this unit can also support, this unit can act as the hub of your system.  This versatility gives you the ability to work with older TVs that don't have an optical-out.  A minor addition that significantly increases the number of consumers that can benefit from this device.As you can tell by now, I'm a really big fan of this speaker.  For a bedroom TV, a kid's room, or an apartment set up, these are ideal.  For your main entertainment system, I'd lean toward a true 5.1 set up, but if you don't like wires and electronics all around your room, then this is a very budget friendly alternative.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Clearly better than its cheaper competition", "unixReviewTime": 1398124800, "reviewTime": "04 22, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A1DX757BJI4V4K", "asin": "B00HXTHFJA", "reviewerName": "Daniel D.

Field \"christoph281\"", "helpful": [72, 78], "reviewText": "I wont bother with image quality, it is the same as the XE-2, basically the same as the Xpro-1. This is a hit or miss with some people, i wont waste any time as this is not what makes this camera unique in Fuji's lineup.  Read any Fuji X-trans review for image quality. All I will say is it is top notch.I have been shooting with the XE-1 and OMD EM-5 for the last year or so. I primarily do timelapse photography which is comparable to landscape photography, also studio plant timelapse and macro work.  General photography is a hobby of mine. I am not a professional photographer but do use photography professionally, if that makes sense. I moved from Nikon pro gear to mirrorless cameras to save weight for extended hikes to remote areas.the XT-1 is about as perfect as a camera (for my purposes) as i have ever found, it certainly sets a new bench mark.I doubt I will be using my XE-1 much at all for general photography. I have had this love hate relationship between the OMD and the XE-1. I liked the output of the XE-1, but found the AF to be terrible, the EVF was decent, but nothing to scream about. Everything the XE-1 did poorly the OMD excelled at, everything the OMD fell short in the XE-1 excelled in.The XT-1 is so much faster in operation than the XE-1. the AF is very fast, it seems to be very accurate. Compared to any other mirrorless camera on the market the AF-C  tracks like a bloodhound. Which to say it is about as good as a prosumer level DSLR.  The viewfinder is not only usable, it is darn good.I think the XT-1's EVF is probably the first one that really starts to threaten the OVF. Looking through this one, I would suspect the EVF is only 2 maybe 3 small generations to outperforming an OVF in every way imaginable. Not quite there yet, but that gap between the XE-1 EVF and a solid 100% view pentaprism OVF just got a lot smaller. And dont worry, the EVF future is looking incredible! There is NO percieveable lag in the viewfinder, I would suspect the lag is insignificant compared to the average persons response time. meaning, you wont lose the shot due to lag, even in low light scenarios.For the build quality, i would say using a DSLR comparison it would be like a D800 vs a D7x00 series. Or a 5Dmk3 vs a 60D. Where you pick it up and are somehow immediately able to recognize it as something that is very well crafted and designed, and that it is a thing if quality. The knobs feel fantastic, the textured faux leather is far nicer than the XE-1's, it feels like it was machined out of a solid piece. Even the LCD screen feels solid and confidant. That is how the XT-1 not only feels compared to the XE-1, but it also looks that way too. I'm not 100% how to describe it, but I'm sure everyone understands exactly what I am talking about. This is a serious camera, I have owned and enjoyed the Fuji XE-1, first gen Olympus Pen, Olympus OMD, Sony NEX-3, Sony NEX-5N, and Nikon J1, I have handled the NEX6, and NEX7. I liked all those cameras, they all had thier strengths and weaknesses, however this is the first mirrorless camera I have ever held that feels like a professional grade tool. It looks great in the pictures, it looks and feels amazing in your hand. I would be wary of the opinion of anybody who says this is anything but a solidly constructed tool.well, except for the side door which feel as cheap as ever. and the unlock buttons on the dials are&#34;ok&#34;. And of course, the rear buttons sure are flush. so its not all puppies and sunshine, but those seem awfully insignificant in the long run (to me at least).The flash they give in, well, i havent used it yet, and i probably wont. But it feels nicer than the clip on flash that came with the NEX3, NEX5, and OMD, which all felt like junk to me.(I have not used or tested the SONY A7(r) or A6000, Olympus OMD EM-1. Sony and Olympus both make fantastic gear, i love all brands, my raving about the XT-1 should not be viewed as an attack on these fantastic cameras, to be honest though, I have yet to hold a mirrorless camera from ANY brand that feels as good as this)This is NOT a light camera. For some reason everyone seems way too zoned in on the fact a camera CAN be smaller when mirrorless, and yes, it can, but I would think the larger benefit is the ability to go with smaller lens elements, reducing the cost for high quality lenses. I mean come on, we are all adults here, garbage in, garbage out. That is what lured me into the Fuji system is the excellent optics, the 35 1.4 is every bit as sharp as the Nikon 24-70 f/2.8 which i owned for years, but costs a fraction of the price (different lens different purposes i know, but the idea remains the same). I cant say enough about the Fuji lenses that i have used. Currently my lineup includes the 18-55 (best kit lens ever made period) the 35mm f/1.4, and the 14mm f/2.8. All three of these lenses have strong reputations for a very good reason.Im handling mine right now with the 14 f/2.8 and i tell ya what, I cant imagine this was any lighter than my D7000 and the 35mm 1.4 lens. This is NOT a pocketable camera. Even with a pancake lens, unless you have comically large pants with giant pockets full of ipads and animals.As for customization, that can all be found online as well. You can customize the crap out of this camera. The manual focus assist options are fantastic, the response time is near instant, the back LCD looks fantastic, and the Wifi works like a champ. Where as the first Fujis were a bit limited in options and gimmicks, this thing has the whole catalog and more. And the best part is if you dont like that junk, and just want to use it as a manual camera, well, go ahead. None of that stuff gets in the way. This camera can be as basic, or as advanced as YOU wish. It is a camera that easily molds itself to your style of shooting.As for the XE-1, it will probably be kept as a backup camera, but live most of its life on one of my motion controlled time lapse rigs with my OMD. I just got the parts to build out a battery adapter so i can run it with large capacity batteries for extended timelapse in the field, or plug it into the wall if needed.This is hands down the best mirrorless camera i have ever held.

With the exception with a small handful of petty grievances, this may be as perfect a camera you can get in the compact System Camera sector.Image Quality - one word superb.  the 16mp X-Trans CMOS II sensor is capable of so much detail, and contrast.  the colors are great as well.  Auto White balance seems to do a pretty good job in judging a scene.  The lenses I have used so far - 18-55 f/2.8-4 kit, 35mm f/1.4 and 56mm f/1.2 are all very very good, and sharp and contrasty.  I dont miss any of my canon glass, except maybe my 135mm f/2.0L, which Fuji does not have an analog for, however, i picked myself up a leica 90mm Summicron-M f/2 and a 3rd party M-X adapter, and it does nicely.  I would however love to see a fuji AF enabled fast 90mm lens.Handling - not bad at all.  My hands have been described as meat hooks, but i have to say, the camera is very comfortable to hold, even without the add on grip extenders that are available.  the buttons are a bit crowded on the back, but that is to be expected on such a compact design.  After a short time of use, you get use to it, and its not that much of a big deal anymore.Shooting - Viewfinder is amazing, LCD is great, AF is very good, high speed shooting is very doable.menus - not too bad, i love the customizable function buttons, everything is pretty easy to get to with only a few clicks at most.  I do have one major wish that COULD be fixed in firmware, so fujidoods, if you're listening, read below.greivances:1/4000 max shutter and base ISO 200(RAW) - losing 1 full stop with the shutter, plus another with the high base ISO make daylight shooting with wide(r) apertures challenging.  I used to shoot f/1.2 1/8000 iso 50 in bright sun, this is something that cannot be done on this camera without the use of ND filters, which also darkens the view finder, and all but the best quality filters affect the image negatively.unable to customize quick menu.  I would LOVE to customize the Q menu with my most used features.  this would greatly reduce my time thumbing through the various menusISO dial lock can be annoying, but not the end of the world.The electronic Aperture ring on the lenses are too easily moved, while zooming, Manual focusing, or even during shooting while holding the lens.  a clicking aperture ring would prevent this, or moving the aperture function to the front control wheel would help as well, though that would make it somewhat painful to use.  CLICKING APERTURE RING!Unable to shoot tethered in the studio.  Attaching a USB cord disables the camera.  using the remote control feature with wireless is somewhat useful, but MUCH less, when you want to shoot from the camera position (hand held) and want to send images to a laptop or tablet automatically.  I like to shoot RAW+Small JPEG in studio, and send the JPEG to my laptop while keeping the RAW on the Flash Card.  the only way to do this type of photography right now is with a 3rd party eyefi card.  This should be able to be fixed with a new firmware to allow hardwired tethering, or eyefi like wireless tethering.Lack of a fast telephoto prime for portrait shooters (90mm f/2.0 or 1.8)  OIS would be gravy, though not required by me.In fact on sensor OIS would have been niceThis camera with a 23mm f/1.4, 35mm f/1.4, 56mm f/1.2, and a fast 90mm is the ultimate kit covering everything that I shoot.  I dont miss anything from my 5D Mark II, especially not the weight with all those heavy L lenses.  You do lose a little shallow DOF (not enough of a difference for it to mean much to me), But IQ and Lens quality in such a small package is very hard to beat.NOTE:  if you like to shoot video, this is not your camera.  It lacks everything a serious videographer would want, except maybe the stereo mic input, but then again, most every other serious video camera has that anyway.Thank you Fujifilm!

Yes but once you give it a shot and try this camera I'm pretty sure you're going to love it.Amazing piece of equipment that can be used professionally if desired and can rival big DSLRs and often perform much better.I thought ISO performance of my pentax was all the way up there, guess what, this Fuji camera is even better.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Spectacular camera.", "unixReviewTime": 1393977600, "reviewTime": "03 5, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A2YX32ZMIVPUNQ", "asin": "B00HYAL84G", "reviewerName": "Michael C. Jackson \"MysticMCJ\"", "helpful": [18, 20], "reviewText": "I used to be a Nikon guy...  I started with a 70's FG, and when I went digital, I went to the Nikon DX format - mostly because at the time, it was the only option I could afford that still gave me the control I wanted.  I was an SLR purist.Cut to now - The DX format has excelled at offering several excellent bodies, but if you want anything good other than a super-zoom, you have to go third party, and if you want a prime, you have to select from the very, very small pool of DX primes, or live with FX primes, which are great if you don't mind the extra weight and never need a wide angle.I picked up an X-Pro on discount some time back, because Fuji had caught my attention with the return to intuitive selection of shutter speed / aperture, especially with the return of aperture rings to lenses.  I fell in love with the X-Pro, but it wasn't fast enough to replace my D7100, the EVF lagged, and the OVF wasn't as useful as I wished....  I still preferred how it handled, and the excellent lens quality of the 35mm F1.4 as well as the light 18mm F2, but it couldn't always keep up.  Firmware helped, but the EVF was still - well, irritating to use at times.The X-T1 took every complaint I had about the X-Pro, and fixed it - big time.  I thought I would miss the OVF, but I don't - I don't even think about it.  The EVF is THAT good.With the excellent collection of primes that Fuji has released, as well as the SURPRISINGLY excellent 18-55mm &#34;kit&#34; lens (that's nicer than any DX zoom offered, with the possible exception of the 17-55, but that's debatable), I've had no need for any of my Nikon gear - and the X-T1 is an absolute joy to use, in every way.  Focus is spot on and fast - Not always as lightning quick as some SLR lenses can be, but still faster than most.This and the 23mm F1.4 have become my go-to kit... That, the 14mm, and the 55-200 have become a travel kit of sorts - and I'll likely switch out to the 56mm instead of the zoom at some point.  The quality and versatility is unmatched at this size.At this point in the evolution of digital cameras, any reasonable camera will be sufficient - the camera generally isn't the limiting factor, the photographer is.  That being said, there is a lot of value in a camera that works the way you want it to, and doesn't get in your way.  The Fuji X-T1 excels at that.... and combined with the XF lenses with aperture rings, I feel VERY comfortable with the camera, and not so much like I'm fighting it.Will this do all of the 3-D focus tracking like the D7100 will?  Nope, it won't.  However, it has been much more consistent about actually hitting the focus points at high speeds - If I drop the X-T1 into CH mode, every frame will be tack sharp - where the focus selector is positioned, that is.  While some DSLRs may track better, I haven't seen the same degree of keepers...  but YMMV.  If you are a TRUE action-oriented shooter, and really nutty hard-to-track action, then likely the DSLR is still the right tool for you.  If you aren't really pushing that functionality to its limits, the X-T1 will likely keep up just as well.I use this for travel as well as more intentional photography.  I also use it in the studio with strobes.  I basically use this EVERYWHERE except for where I can't bring interchangeable lens cameras...  It has taken excellent photos in low-light concerts, it has excelled while hiking.  There is not anything I have found that this isn't an ideal camera -- for ME.  For you?  That depends...If you are looking to switch systems, take a good look at why and what you need.  There are still some gaps in the lineup (although not many) that may not meet your needs.Beware that the weather sealing is for the body only, there are only three lenses on the roadmap that are weather sealed.... and none of them are primes at the time of this writing.  If you shoot primes in the rain, well, an SLR may still be for you.  That's an edge case, though.If you are looking to grab a good body with a good kit zoom and nothing else, this will do the trick - but likely so will others, if you aren't as interested in how the camera operates.  If you don't want to control shutter speed, ISO, or aperture manually, then this is NOT the camera for you - It will do fine in all auto modes, don't think otherwise, but that WILL likely get in your way.I've been shooting with this since it was released, and literally have zero complaints about it.

The problem is that they are both so great. But there are negatives as well as positives for each. Every one raves about the superb view finder of the X-Ti, and it is great, but doing a side by side comparison, the E-M1 has a brighter view. With the sun at a certain angle it was at times difficult seeing the X-T1 image on the screen and viewfinder. The E-M1 remained clear regardless of the angle of the sun. However the view through the Fuji was larger. The retro. dials on the Fuji make adjustments very easy. The Olympus also is easy to adjust, but I think fuji wins out in this department. The olympus shutter speed goes to 1/8000 vs 1/4000 for the Fuji. Neither has an ND filter so shooting with the fuji f1.4 lenses or their forthcoming f1.2 lens in bright sunlight wide open would be more of a problem than with the Olympus. At this price point the Fuji should have gone to 1/8000.Fuji has some superb beautifully constructed and needle sharp lenses. Olympus can use a huge selection of micro 4/3 lenses including many excellent ones from Panasonic, so you have more of a choice. However the Olympus micro 4/3 sensor is smaller than that of the Fuji and at higher iso produces more noise. Finally, Olympus wins out in the image stabilization department with its in body stabilization. Any lens you use on it will be stabilized. Also, in my 70 years of owning many cameras and lenses I've never seen an image stabilizer as good as that of the Olympus. Olympus wins by a wide margin in that department.Another advantage for Olympus is in the placement of the tripod socket. I have many arca compatible plates and all blocked the battery compartment on the Fuji. But I'm sure that third party plates will be available before too long that solve this problem. Fuji will be distrbuting their MHG-XT Metal Hand Grip in a week or two which will provide access to the battery compartment and which will be compatible with arca swiss style heads.As I'm writing this it seems that the advantage goes to Olympus and my choice should be obvious, however the images from the Fuji are simply breath taking.

I relied on an extensive set of Nikon gear (I was a loyal Nikon user/buyer for over 30 years) with a retail value in excess of $12,000.  I came to hate all this gear and everything associated with it, including photography.  Recently, I decided to try and re-kindle my lifelong love of photography.  I sold off all my Nikon gear, as well as supporting gear such as Pocket Wizards, monolights, numerous gear bags, light stands, tons of light modifiers, etc&#8230;.  I first bought the Fuji X100s and was immediately inspired.  I came to love the Fuji X100s so much; I gave the Fuji XT-1 a try.  Please note, I did not review video aspects of this camera as I rarely use this feature.The Fuji XT-1 comes packaged very well.  The build quality of the camera is very good.  Note, I purchased my camera after the reported light leaks were resolved.  I put the build quality of the camera on par, or even better, than the build quality of the legendary and proven Nikon D300s and the more recent D800- just without the weight and size.  The body is solid, but not heavy.  Knobs and dials provide some of the best tactical feedback I have ever felt.  The body feels &#8220;old school&#8221; in so many ways, it is fascinating.  I simply find this camera body among the best I have ever used. Even though the body is incredibly compact, ergonomics and design are well engineered.  The camera body is comfortable to hold even without an extended grip. Buttons are a little crowded on the back but not unexpected in this design and after some use, you will be able to use all the buttons and dials without even looking. The design simply lends itself to the craft of photography, perhaps like few other cameras.The 16mp X-Trans CMOS II sensor is capable of an incredible amount of detail and contrast. Auto White balance is fairly good job in assessing varying scene.  The 18-55 f/2.8-4 kit, 35mm f/1.4 and 56mm f/1.2 provide very shard, detailed, and well contrasted images in nearly any environment to the point I do not lust for my professional Nikon lenses I came to rely on throughout the years.  Of particular note, the 18-55 &#8220;kit lens&#8221; is not of the same quality &#8220;kit&#8221; lens you would find in a Nikon &#8220;kit&#8221; lens.  The 18-55 is a high quality impressive lens both in specifications and practical application.  Having used the Fuji X-E2 for a short period of time, and comparing raw files processed in the same manner, I found the images nearly identical (that&#8217;s a great thing).  Both Lightroom and Photoshop now provide full support for RAW processing.  Autofocus performance is far better than the X-E2 and more than sufficient for low light shooting.  Without a doubt, this is not the camera I would use for high-speed sport shooting.  However, for nearly every other situation, including weddings, landscape, portrait, children, children sports, macro, etc&#8230;, this is my camera of choice.  There have been very few situations in which I wished for my Nikon bodies.  Initially I was hesitant about committing to an EVF (electronic view finder).  However, Fuji, in all their models, gets it right- especially in the X-T1.  Impressive is the best word to use in describing the viewfinder.This review could go on for pages. However, there are many other extensive reviews available.  In summation, I sold off all my Nikon gear and made the complete transition to Fuji cameras and the XT-1, without regret.  This is a very advanced camera that calls into question the need for larger DSLR bodies delivering 36mp of data you will never need/use.

I've been a fan of the mirror-less system since it was first introduced with the 4x3rds but there was never any camera that I thought was worth keeping because the lenses were average or the sensors were behind the rest of the market.Pros:  The size, the build quality, the image quality, and complete control over the final image.  I like the way they thought this out and included everything even time lapse and monochrome with red, or yellow, or orange, etc.  I've had experience with Fuji's excellent view camera lenses which are as good as, or better, than any manufacturer in the world and they blew the pro photographers away in the 90s with great films like Velvia and Provia, and I see that kind of thinking here.  It's quick and starts up almost instantly.  This camera with the kit lens is an excellent value and I can't wait to get a prime lens to put on it. Update, the kit lens is a really good lens, so good that I'm going to pass on a prime for now.  I also bought the 55 - 200 mm and it's another really good lens.  If I buy another lens it will be the Fujifilm wide angle zoom.Cons: Give me a few more days with the camera and I'm sure I'll find something, I always do, and when I do I'll update this. Update: it is sometimes slow waking up from sleep, slow enough to miss a shot so I have it set to not go to sleep.  There isn't much to write about here.

Although the sound quality is not as good as my Boston Acoustic or Logitech airplay speakers (more on that later), everything else about this internet radio is superb:  the interface, the features, even the retro look.This is a big box, reminiscent of old style stereos:  13.5\" w x 9.5\" d x 5\" h.  There are two knobs on top, one for volume and one for navigating the menu, and two round speakers on the front.  But there's where the comparison to old school ends.  It has a bright color screen on front that lists all the radio options:  Internet radio, Pandora (free subscription), Sirius XM (paid subscription), USB drive playback, Rhapsody (subscription), and others.  You can program your favorite radio stations just as you can with a traditional radio.  You can use preset 1 for a public radio station, preset 2 for a SiriusXM station, and preset 3 for a Pandora \"station\" -- up to 10 presets in all.  You can set the alarm to be awakened by the radio -- every day, once a week, on work days only, on weekends, up to seven different times with radio or a buzzer -- or you can set the sleep timer so you can go to sleep listening.  (I'd love to set a duration limit so it will turn off after coming on via alarm, but that doesn't seem possible.  It stays on until I turn it off.)  When the radio is on standby, it displays the time in large, easy-to-read but not super-bright numbers.To set it up, all you need to do is enter your security code for your network in the settings mode, and it does the rest -- well, almost.  You can listen to internet radio without doing anything else; however, to use the full range of options, you need to register at Grace Digital and enter your credentials for your subscription to, say, Pandora.  Sirius XM must be activated on the radio itself. (You must have a paid all-access or internet subscription for this to work.)Before getting this internet radio, I used various devices to get the same content, but they always required multiple steps.  For instance, if I wanted to listen to Sirius XM, I had to get out my iPhone or iPad, select the app, wait for it to connect, and then press the AirPlay key to stream it through an AirPlay speaker.  Or I had to go through the menu on my TV to get there.  Or I had to start the radio on my computer first.  This radio bypasses all that.  It acts just like a traditional, free-standing radio, although you have to wait several seconds for the buffering or the network connection.The sound quality is weakest aspect of the whole set-up, and even then, it's pretty darn good.  If I hadn't already had my AirPlay speakers, I wouldn't have known that the sound could be much better.  Listening to XM radio first through the Grace Digital and then through the Boston Acoustic speakers revealed marked differences between the two.  The Grace Digital just doesn't have the richness of sound that the Boston Acoustic does.  With the subwoofer on the bottom of the box, lifted a half-inch or so off the shelf by the feet, it doesn't have much bass.  The mid- and upper-ranges, while good, sound thin in comparison.  But, hey, the Grace Digital still sounds TONS better than the traditional stereo I used until a few years ago, simply because of the digital nature of internet radio versus air wave radio.Within certain limits, the Grace Digital radio can act as a media server.  It works only with a PC, not a Mac, and as far as I can tell, it cannot stream iTunes.  (I have a Mac so I can't test it, although there's no mention of iTunes in the manual.)  The radio DOES pick up my Seagate shared media drive, so any MP3 files I have on it can be played on the Grace Digital.  To access this feature, you have to go to Media Server on the menu, then select UPnP.  You will see a list of available media storage devices that you can then access.In addition to being network-ready, the Encore has a headphone jack in front and a USB port and Aux In/Out jacks in back.  The unit comes with the aux cables.  It also comes with a remote control. There are free iPhone and Android apps so you can use your phone as a remote.For this to work for you, you must have a high-speed broadband connection.  If you cannot listen to internet radio on your computer without frequent buffering or stuttering, don't even try this.  You will be disappointed.  If you have a fast internet connection and want internet radio in a room other than where your computer is, you'll likely love this. as much as I do.

Just Wow.", "unixReviewTime": 1391558400, "reviewTime": "02 5, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A1E1LEVQ9VQNK", "asin": "B00HZN1WXE", "reviewerName": "J. Chambers", "helpful": [7, 8], "reviewText": "A couple of years ago, I reviewed a Grace Digital GDI-IR2600 Wi-Fi Internet Radio (the &#34;Innovator&#34;). It was love at first sight, and my wife and I have gotten a ton of enjoyment from it. But the new GDI-IRC7500 Stereo radio (the &#34;Encore&#34;) is even more impressive, and I've spent way too much time this week listening to radio stations from around the world. It's just really cool to be eating lunch while listening to the news on my regular local radio station, then push one of the presets and after a few seconds of buffering the live stream, here's a BBC station with the live traffic report in downtown London. It's very addicting, especially with thousands of radio stations available worldwide.Setup was simple and only took a few minutes. The 53-page illustrated user's guide is clearly written, and there's a Quick Start guide to get you up and running with the basics. Find your wi-fi from the list of available networks, and click on it, enter your password, and the connection is made. I've never really gotten into Pandora or iHeartRadio, so after setting the time and date, I went straight to Internet Radio and cruised the world's radio stations, searching by location, genre, or college stations. There's also a &#34;Local&#34; selection, and the radio automatically knew where I lived. You can also search for a particular radio station by its call sign. There's even a weather forecast for your town, displayed graphically on the front panel.The GDI-IRC7500 looks great with its dark wood-grain finish, although it might be a bit too big for the average nightstand. But inside the cabinet is the finest audio system that I've ever heard from a tabletop radio. It's really good, with a clarity and crispness of vocals and even great bass sounds that you can feel as well as hear. If you want a bigger sound, connect some speakers. This is a stereo radio, so FM stations that stream stereo to the internet will come through in stereo. Unlike conventional airwaves radio, there's no trace of static or fading, even at night. The Encore's speakers pump out more than enough sound to fill a large room. The 3&#34; front-mounted speakers are also rear-ported. Apparently this allows some of the sound to reflect off walls that are behind the radio and spread the sound. There's also a bottom-facing 4&#34; woofer that makes a huge difference in the quality of the bass. Granted, it's not Dolby surround sound, but it's pretty effective. For private listening, there's a 3.5mm stereo headphone jack on the front panel of the radio. I used a set of headphones, and the sound was fine.The radio will also play your music from a USB flash drive, so I put a flash drive with a music playlist into the USB port on the back of the radio. The music sounded great, but I was most interested in checking the stereo quality, so on the flash drive, I had two stereo setup MP3s (&#34;Channel Balance Test&#34; and &#34;Stepped Stereo Pan Test&#34;), and the radio checked out perfectly for stereo balance and separation. While playing tracks from a flash drive, the controls on the set top and the remote allow the same forward/pause/back as most media players do.The Encore will play music from a shared folder on a PC. The user's guide includes instructions for allowing sharing with Windows Vista and Windows 7. Unfortunately, having only recently gone with Windows 8, I'm still in the fog, but I'm working on it.I'm in the process of setting up a collection of my favorite stations using a feature called &#34;My Stuff,&#34; where you can organize stations in folders and get to them from the My Stuff icon on the home page. This is a really cool feature that's much more flexible than using the station presets.In the Settings menu is a feature called &#34;Equalization,&#34; which allows you to dial in the bass and treble to suit yourself, or use the presets for different types of music. It's a nice feature that can customize the sound to your own tastes, but after trying it, I preferred the Presets.Virtually every function can be controlled with the infrared remote control, a very handy device. I also downloaded the free app by Grace Digital to allow remote control through the network from an Android smartphone or tablet, but so far, I haven't gotten the app to find the Encore on my network. I'm running the app on a Kindle Fire HDX 7&#34; tablet.The Encore is also an alarm-radio. The seven alarms and a sleep timer are nice touches that replicate functions found on traditional tabletop clock-radios. For a wake-up alarm, you can choose either the buzzer (adjustable volume) or a preset radio station.Over the last four days, I've had the Encore on for about ten hours total, and I haven't noticed any dropouts.SUMMARY: The Encore is a state-of-the-art full-function digital internet radio that looks good, sounds great, and provides far more functionality than traditional tabletop radios.A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A state of the art internet radio with a boatload of features", "unixReviewTime": 1391644800, "reviewTime": "02 6, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A38T94RSGFJHWZ", "asin": "B00HZOW5K2", "reviewerName": "David O.

Tested using Samsung's Magician UtilitySequential Read MB/s:  OCZ 511  Samsung 405 = 26% in favor of OCZSequential Write MB/s:  OCZ 493  Samsung 281 = 75% in favor of OCZRandom Read IOPS:  OCZ 52,954  Samsung 45,080 = 17% in favor of OCZRandom Write IOPS:  OCZ 38,346  Samsung 19,684 = 95% in favor of OCZI built a system in July 2013 and bought a Samsung 840 EVO 250 GB SSD which has worked quite well, except that it has never quite felt as fast as I thought it should be. I use Samsung's TRIM utility regularly. I received this OCZ 240 GB SSD a few days ago. I also bought an OCZ SSD several months ago and it is running in a second desktop computer with Windows 8 and has worked quite well. I decided to first clone the Samsung SSD to a 10,000 RPM WD VelociRaptor 250 first just so I could put it through a thorough disk defragmention so that the data would be compacted.  Some cloning software allows defragmentation on the fly, but I wasn't sure the free download of Acronis True Image would do that. But that brings up another topic.I already had the 2010 version of Acronis True Image on my computer. The free 2013 downloaded version insisted I had to remove my 2010 version.  Afterwards I learned this free download from OCZ is not a full version of True Image. It would not allow me to clone my Samsung SSD to a regular hard drive, even though it went through all the steps.  I am sure if you are just cloning a laptop hard drive, this limited version will work.  By the way, clean up your old hard drive and defragment it before cloning it to a SSD.  So I finally downloaded a free trial version of 2014 Acronis True Image only to learn the cloning function is disabled.  I finally found some wonderful free cloning software called Macrium Reflect that supports the GPT boot technique verses the old MBR style. So when you format your SSD, choose GPT instead of MBR assuming your hardware supports GPT. This free Reflect utility from Macrium is far superior to Acronis True Image in my opinion - and I do a lot of cloning.  Of course, all it does is clone disks, but that's all I wanted.So I was finally able to clone my disk to a regular high speed hard drive and it worked perfectly. I updated Windows and used CCleaner (also free) to clean the registry and get rid of all the junky internet files. Afterwards run the Windows utility called Disk Cleanup and select Clean Up System Files. CCleaner doesn't clean up everything and vice versa. I downloaded my favorite all time free defragmenter software called PowerDefragmenter along with the required companion utility called Contig.  I set it for triple pass to really get all the files into single contiguous files.  A lot of the other defragmenters only do this partially and are perfectly content with two or three fragments and call it done.Next I cloned my WD VelociRaptor disk image to this OCZ SSD and it worked perfectly first time.  My boot time is dramatically faster than it was with the Samsung SSD.  I think it may possibly be because of my intermediate step of cloning to the regular hard drive and defragmenting before loading onto the OCZ, but I can't be sure of that. Personally, I believe the OCZ SSD is just a lot faster.  I used Samsung's Magician SSD performance utility to measure the difference in the table above, so it is accurate. Be sure to download the OCZ Toolbox so you can manually run TRIM periodically. I forgot to measure the exact boot time with the Samsung SSD, but I did check it with my WD VelociRaptor hard drive. It took 2 minutes and 20 seconds for the VelociRaptor to fully boot to a useable state. It only takes 37 seconds with the OCZ SSD to the exact same point. That is 3.8 times faster. I know the Samsung SSD was taking well over a minute with the exact same data configuration (exact clone except for defragmenting). The OCZ boots up in about half the time of the Samsung SSD. About half my boot time is going through my MSI motherboard POST cycle. The Samsung SSD was never this fast and I installed Windows 7 from scratch. Both the OCZ and Samsung SSDs hit the limit of 7.9 on Window's Experience Index. They are both really fast, but right now, I can honestly say my OCZ setup is running much faster than the Samsung SSD.  I don't know how much to attribute to my intermediate step to defragment the files before cloning it to OCZ.  Anyway, I'm not changing back. It's a lot faster and I'm quitting while I'm ahead. The machined aluminum OCZ SSD housing is much heavier than the plastic Samsung SSD. It must weight 4 or 5 times as much as the Samsung SSD.It took me a lot of hours to do all this (mostly the defragment time), but I'm extremely pleased to have a very fast system now - fastest I've ever had. I spend a lot of money on high performance computer systems. I am using anAMD FX 4350 Unlocked Quad Core Processor 4.2 4 FD4350FRHKBOX, Black Editionrunning at 4.6 GHz.  My next system will be the newly released Intel i7. And now that Toshiba bought OCZ, I am now confident OCZ is here to stay with solid financial backing. The next SSD I purchase will be another OCZ SSD. I received this OCZ SSD free, but I bought the Samsung and my other OCZ SSD. And it isn't entirely free. It takes a lot of time to evaluate products and I do it as accurately as I know how - no fluff from me.

Granted, a 240GB SSD isn't as much storage capacity as a modern 1TB or 2TB hard drive, but 240GB is enough for most users who don't have massive libraries of high-resolution images or a Steam library with several dozen games that you play regularly.This SSD works fine for desktop owners or &#34;most&#34; laptop users, but some of the &#34;Ultrabook&#34; style thin-and-light laptops made in recent years require a smaller &#34;mSATA&#34; SSD because a standard 2.5-inch SATA drive like this one won't fit inside. Be sure to check the specs for your laptop (or contact the manufacturer) to see if your laptop uses a standard SATA drive or a smaller mSATA (or another form factor SSD).Boot times into Windows 8 are marginally faster with this drive than with the older Vertex 4, but it's really only noticeable if you break out a stopwatch. The main advantage of using this drive as far as I'm concerned is that it has a higher capacity than my old 128GB drive.I never had any issues with the older Vertex 4 and I don't anticipate any problems with the new Vertex 460, but OCZ has an okay reputation for customer service should I have a problem.Overall, highly recommended.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A good solid state drive for a reasonable price.", "unixReviewTime": 1405296000, "reviewTime": "07 14, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "AHVJLFFQ3VWWY", "asin": "B00HZR4DNG", "reviewerName": "Skeezix", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "My 7 year old grandson uses an old Dell Optiplex with Windows Vista Home Premium to play computer games when he visits.

It runs warm, but doesn't seem to effect the reliability for performance. And performance it has. It is hands down faster than my Samsung Evo. My main PC, with otherwise similar specs for CPU, doesn't boot nearly as fast or load maps nearly as quick. The Barefoot controller is simply put, better than Sandforce or Samsung's ARM controller at delivering a smoother experience.I think what really killed OCZ was Sandforce controllers and the iffy firmware for those controllers. A variety of Sandforce drives have identical problems to OCZ, but OCZ was the largest OEM of Sandforce SSD's, using it in virtually their entire lineup. Intel is the only OEM of Sandforce-driven drives that I haven't seen a failure in, but they are also slower and the most expensive. As far as Intel drives go, the best are still the SSD320 (X25-M.)I took a gamble on this drive, joking with myself that it'd quickly fail or give me a headache. I'm pleasantly surprised, and simply due to OCZ personal redemption from past experiences, it gets 5-stars for showing what a substantial improvement they've made throughout their SSD history.

Not this one; it is reasonably priced, so I ordered it to see how well they did. I find it to be quite usable considering the specifications, with excellent BIOS security and other corporate-use features, to have slightly above average battery life with adequate performance, but to be a bit slow for any gaming use.Design:The right side has SDHC card reader, Headphone/Mic combined port, 2 USB 2.0 Ports, a RJ-45 LAN port, and a Kensington security slot. The left side has the power port, a full sized 15 pin VGA port, an HDMI port, and a USB3 port. The bottom has two slits for sound. This device has a touch screen, which is great at the price point. When opened, the screen has a camera port, a camera indicator, and a microphone. The lower portion (below the screen) has the power switch and a multi-light panel that indicates power, wireless, charge level, HDD activity, and caps lock; it is nice that these are on top when the unit is open, to see the status (especially the HDD light). The device features an unusual hinge; the hinge goes around behind the keyboard, reducing the height of the screen when opened. Overall, it is a bit bulkier than most ultras; the end near the screen is thicker. This is due to the hinge, but it also means that the keyboard has a good tilt for typing, and that there is enough depth for a full sized VGA port (most ultras have only HDMI), and a wired network cable on the other. I think it is a good compromise; the unit is fairly light but a bit bulky.  The device includes Asus Webstorage (5gb).Battery:I tested the laptop from a full charge, using the recommended settings (about 35% screen brightness). It lasted around 5 hours with the screen on and moderate use, and I think that the time could be pushed to 6 hours with more efficient settings.Performance:I could tell that this was not a high end ultra. The screen, despite the modest resolution, is very readable from the front, below, and sides, but loses some visibility when viewed at the upper angles. I found that it will run a couple of programs well, maybe three, but after that there was some visible slowness. The performance was strangely variable; at some times it was quite snappy, but other times it seemed to take a while for the hard disk to kick in. Nevertheless, it is perfectly suitable for general word processing and spreadsheet use, and will be fine for basic video viewing, Skype, and that sort of thing. The hard drive is a Hitachi HTS545050A7E680, and runs at 5400 RPM. Most ultras come with only 256 Mb at most (and generally use an SSD), but this drive gives one 500 Mb of storage. However an SSD will be about 6 times faster - and way more expensive. The drive speed and type accounts for some of the slowness. The Keyboard has square keys and is well supported (doesn't creak); I found it easy to use.Sound:Surprisingly for a device of this size, the sound on internal speakers was very good, and the headset output was excellent.Corporate Use:I put in this paragraph because the design has some great features for corporate use. The BIOS will allow the system administrator to lock down just about all of the ports (USB, etc), and encrypt the hard drive. I didn't try these features out because I don't intend to use them. Additionally, the full sized VGA port will be useful for connecting to a monitor at the office, and a full sized wired Ethernet RJ-45 connector will allow for secure use at work or in the motel room. The low price makes it an attractive option for those companies that need to outfit a lot of workers with portable computers.Summary: A really good budget laptop, with decent speed for students and professionals.

This really complicates installing games and such, because one will have to be careful where things are installed. It would have been more usable with a simple 500 GB single partition.- The laptop does NOT have Bluetooth, so if you want to add a mouse it will need to be one with a dongle. This omission saves power, but uses up a USB port, and seems a bit strange on an ultra portable.- The laptop is advertised as having the Asus LifeFrame app.  This enhances the camera functions, including the ability to use the webcam as security monitoring device (detects motion and takes a picture), take pictures and videos, voice recorder, and a preview function.

It allows installation of regular Windows programs, while Chromebooks do not. This is one major differentiator in this laptop compared to other small low priced laptops you might consider.How does it look and feel?It looks beautiful. Design has moved a long way in the last few years, especially for less expensive computers. Upon inspection, you could almost mistake this for a Sony Vaio or other high end machine. Open the lid and the screen is shiny-- a touch screen. It also looks beautiful. The keyboard wrist rest is marred by stickers that still come on Windows machines, but easily removed. Next though are some hardware issues that I couldn't fix: The touch-pad is very springy like I have experienced on less expensive laptops. It did not meet my expectations. While it does function, it causes a lot of \"retry\" and less accuracy than even the most typical laptops. It looks very much like a Macbook Air touchpad, but that it is not. The keyboard works acceptably but the buttons there are also quite springy. Luckily I am a mouse person, so plugging in an Anywhere MX fixes my productivity and I move along to exploring the machine.Plugging in myLogitech Wireless Anywhere Mouse MX for PC and Mac, I hop over into the desktop mode, since this is full Windows 8, and not Chromebook OS, or Windows RT, and install the Unifying software for my mouse. It goes fast, and everything about interacting with the OS is fast. Unfortunately though, the hard drive is loud and I can hear it cranking and cranking endlessly. I'm not sure if this is due to system updates on a new machine or why it has so much hard drive activity. I'll monitor this. The system has 4GB of memory and is 64 bit, so it shouldn't be crunching the hard drive so much or so loudly.  I'd normally want to swap that out for an SSD if I had one around.The next thing I did was install Chrome. Simple.  During this process I hear some sounds and surprisingly, the sound is fantastic on this little laptop. A little more testing of the speakers may need to be explored on that later.The other ASUS that I have which is similar is aASUS VivoBook X202E-DH31T 11.6-Inch Touch Laptop. It's definitely heavier being that it is metal, and does have more of a solid premium feel. While the other is heavy duty, it's heavy and I wouldn't really consider it travel material in the way that this one is light and easy to carry.If it came down to choosing between this device and a Chromebook, I would choose this every time because it has a more premium look & feel, has a touch screen and has the ability to install local applications. I don't necessarily personally prefer Windows 8, but as a mobility device it is more flexible than a Chromebook for nearly the same price, or a small increment more.If I had my say on how it could be better, the only things I'd change would be to improve the feel of the touch-pad clicking, and to put an SSD in there, no matter how small. The hard drive is loud.Otherwise, this is a very viable option when considered against tablets that can cost twice as much, laptops that can cost infinitely more, and Chromebooks which can cost less but offer a lot less flexibility. If you can't spend the money on an ultra book or you have minimal cash to spend on a laptop this option is quite nice compared to what you'd get just two years ago at the same price.If you have any specific questions I'd be happy to answer them in the forum below.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Something between a Chromebook and a Tablet", "unixReviewTime": 1395619200, "reviewTime": "03 24, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A3KZPTQVZ5QG8P", "asin": "B00HZWJGS8", "reviewerName": "Dawn Richardson", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "This product is great!

We go overnight fishing and it is nice to know that all the electronics can be kept charged so we can keep in touch with each other and our kids.  I received this item for free to test it, and I have!!!  I've charged my iPhone with it 2 1/2 times without having to charge the battery in between.

Fowler", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "I&#8217;ve mentioned before, when I tested the Maxboost 10000mAh Pulse, that one thing I dislike is a company that makes claims that overreach the capability of their product.  As a rule I haven&#8217;t been enamored with battery packs that feature a digital display.  Everyone always seemed to love them except for me and the reason being was that they seemed to drop way too much charge when initializing.  The manufacturers claimed that, more or less, it was standard procedure.  Frankly, I never bought into that theory.I still don&#8217;t buy into that theory because I think that it&#8217;s a faulty one simply made up to justify a poor performance.  The Maxboost Electron+ only dropped 5% of it&#8217;s charge and boosted my iPad&#8217;s by 14% in thirty minutes.  Initially it seems a tad slow, but then steadily moved along.  I usually use a first generation iPad to test all my battery packs to provide consistency.My informal testing says a lot and what is says is that the Maxboost Electron+ is a dependable battery pack that is a performer.  It will do what you want when you want it to.  There are a lot of decent battery packs out on the market now and manufacturers are stepping up to the plate to provide top notch ones. Maxboost has definitely joined the club with the Electron+.START:The iPad: 12%The Maxboost Electron+ 100%15 minutes: 15%  -  Electron+ 98%30 minutes:  26%  -  Electron+ 95%60 minutes:  32%  -  Electron+ 94%90 minutes:  45% - Electron+ 91%120 minutes:  50% - Electron+ 90%150 minutes:  60% - Electron+ 88%180 minutes:  69% - Electron+ 76%210 minutes:  79% - Electron+ 73%240 minutes:  87% - Electron+ 71%255 minutes:  96% - Electron+ 70%270 minutes:  100% - Electron+ 68%The Maxboost Electron+ kept on going at a steady rate as I recorded its progress.  I was quite pleased as I watched it&#8217;s steady push as it totally charged my iPad.  My 10000mAh Maxboost did a great job, but the 15000mAh did as well, but left me assured that if I really needed the battery pack, the power would be in my hands.  I&#8217;m particularly thinking of the airport scenario where there are plug hogs.  Sometimes it&#8217;s pretty tough to find an available receptacle to use for charging.Initially I misread the specs on the back of the Maxboost Electron+ and thought I was dealing with a 12000mAh battery pack.  I was quite amazed that the incremental power drops were so small.  With 68% of the Electon&#8217;s charge left I could charge that iPad all over again.  No doubt that this battery pack has power and is a real performer.FEATURES:&#9658;  The world first power pack with digital display window that is capable to exhibit power level within 1% and monitor the input and output charging state.&#9658;  Monster size 15,000mAh battery that can charge almost any portable electronic devices up to 7 times including, iPhone 5/4,4S/3GS, Samsung Galaxy Series, iPad, iPad Mini, and almost all tablets, camera, and MP3s.&#9658;  Multi-port charging capability allows for multiple products to be charged at the same time using a 2.1A and /or 1.0A port.

And I made the comment &#34;If you are not going to see a wall or car outlet for a &#34;scary&#34; long while, this is a great charger to have tucked away.&#34;  Then that winter storm hit more than half of the U.S. and I watched--like most of us did--the Atlanta, GA highway system turn into a parking lot!  &#34;Scary long time&#34; took on new meaning--at least for me it did!  I sat watching the TV screen and imagining some heroic person walking down the highway handing out fully charged Maxboost chargers...  After seeing those poor people stuck on that Georgia highway, I'll never under-estimate the potential for nature--or whatever unknown--to keep me away from a power source!My point is, whether you know in advance you are not going to see an outlet for a long while or you are just considering an external battery charger for &#34;piece of mind&#34;, you might as well get the largest capacity battery, and the most user-friendly battery charger, that you can. This one has the superior charging power you need!I know there are a multitude of chargers available: There are chargers available that are only the size of a business card and fit in your wallet that will allow you to make a call or two in a dire emergency, and there is this &#34;Plus&#34;.  Of course, there are hundreds of external chargers out there for every type of situation in between these two.Only you can decide where your own comfort level is.  You can tempt fate and just plan for a minor inconvenience or you can buy this one and rest easy. But if you think you will need to re-charge your phone and your tablet more than once before you see a charging source, or if you only have a phone and you will want to re-charge it up to ten times before finding a normal charging source--you should consider this charger.This is not a charger for the pocket of your jeans or your evening bag. In a laptop briefcase, in a backpack, in a larger-size purse or in carry-on luggage, the size of this will be inconsequential. It is 10.75 ounces, (the 10000mAh is 8.35 ounces).  Also, at 2 7/8&#34; x 4 7/8&#34;, it is an inch longer than the 10000mAh.  Both sizes have a velour, drawstring pouch to help keep the charger scratch-free and all the adapters and cable together.  (The bag is a bit small for the bigger charger.)Except for its bigger charging capacity, this charger is much like its smaller predecessor:  Both have outstanding charging capabilities.  Besides that major and most important fact:--I have never seen a better user manual: It is very well-written and explains everything and provides accurate pictures. It assumes that you have never used an external charger before. I am very impressed with the simple, little manual. I wish all manuals worked so well.--It has a digital read-out that clues you in to exactly what it is charging at the moment and how much charge power is left. There is no ambiguity, no guesswork at all.--It has a flashlight! I always carry a small flashlight with me. Having the charger and the light in one piece prevents clutter and helps me rationalize the half-pound heft.*I received a sample product from Maxboost.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Perfect for the winter storm that turns your highway into a parking lot!", "unixReviewTime": 1391385600, "reviewTime": "02 3, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A19HMESU9EG12T", "asin": "B00HZWJGS8", "reviewerName": "Tam Nguyen", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "This battery pack seemed really great. Grabbing it out of the box it is really nice and heavy. It comes with a case and cable. It takes about 8 hours to fully charge (so charge when you sleep). The biggest disappointment was in the light and the charge time. The casing (clear part) seems to not be even with the case and may eventually fall off. The numbers on the screen are clear though. I would not recommend putting this in your non-carry-on luggage because it is quite heavy for the size and would be better suited to be carried with you (not worth losing the extra weight with the current bag limits). Regarding the functionality of it, charging two devices (iPad and/or cellphones) at the same time is great. I would recommend this for trips where you are uncertain of available charging stations for two days for a cellphone (under constant use). Over all great product, but with the long charge time and the flimsy light built I would have to give it 3 stars. Maxboost is a great company and have produced great product and customer service.

I can literally count eyelashes on people on the screen even on a Netflix streaming HD movie.Blue-ray movies look incredible!

I came from an awesome 65\" Panny plasma, loved it, still have it in bedroom now.  I've had this one for about 4 weeks and have been giving it the business throwing everything at it 'source-wise.'1st ...The color and brightness is amazing and 'unique,' I believe because of the yellow pixel addition... man, the BLUE skies are a blue like no other, the YELLOW/ORANGES are stunning and the green grass and green jello are in a whole new dimension of \"pop!\" Wow, really delicious stuff that on some well filmed content is just hard to peel your eyes away from!2nd ...Detail, and crispness for a 1080 is really, quit a substantial piece of the pie. I know this isn't part of the review but it is because with better content feed into this beast it can handle it and show you what you've NEVER seen from 1080 before.  I added a new Oppo 103D 3D Blu-ray (this is a $600 blue ray unit ... I know, I know but read on! After adjusted the Darbee video enhancement on the 103D the detail I just wet myself!  It isn't a 4K, no.  BUT, it definitely doesn't look like any 1080 I've ever heard of or seen before, dang!  Absolutely jaw dropping detail! You will not likely think of 3 thinks the same ever again ... sand grains, the human eye and hair!3rd ...Smart Apps, well they do look nice but the duel-core processor just doesn't cut it for me due to sluggishness.  I'm sticking to an zippier external source such as a combo of Oppo/Roku/AppleTV for all the extra app-goodness for 'speed-sake.'  I think the menus looks nice but just doesn't work for me. This is too much money for it to be painful at ANY level.  Really, put a quad-core in there and call it a day for a winning combo or rewrite the heck out of your code to be more processor efficient. The \"adjustments & setup menus\" work flawlessly!4th ... Currently I'm having a real tough time with 'external USB drive' support. In all fairness, I haven't called support directly yet.  I like to be up to my belly button in alligators (understanding all the equipment and how they interact)  before I call so I don't waste their or my time for substantive answers, and I am hopeful their will be a way to make it all work smoothly as I am a serious photographer and rely mostly on video to display my work so this is a particularly important feature set to me. Firmware is up to date. USB 2.0 worked, USB 3.0 did not (so much for backwards compatible.) And I ensured that the proper files system was being utilized and formatted all my media to that standard (I think it was FAT 32 or MSDOS FAT), I run MAC products but keep windows on one mac for such silliness.5th ... 3D is pretty much an 'outer body type of fabulous.'  Don't overly rely on this as I'm new to HOME 3D. I didn't buy it for that 3D function but it works so well and is emplacements pretty dark well too that I bought a dozen 3D movies I was so enthusiastic about it's functionality. A 2D conversion is above \"moderate to okay\" as long as you max out the effect but I don't think we'll be bothering with much that isn't full-on 3D master conversions from studios. We are in our mid 50's so it takes a impressive 'dog and pony' show to excite me about such things. The OPPO's 3D works muck better but the Sharps is pretty good too (on 2D conversions.  On 3D original source, as long as your not immune to the effect and I understand some 5 to 10% of us are, I think it to be a totally immersive experience.  This is where I suggest following the distance guide provide by Sharp, For mine is about10' but I use 20 because of the size of the room...still pretty delicious stuff!6th...When you shut the unit off it goes into a dimmer energy saving mode and rotates classic art. Looks like Monet & Renoir paintings. It's perfect for our multimillion dollar home so we don't have this monster eye sore in our face when its shut off.  Now its very respectable, pleasing, calming and I say quite classy.  It looks like our oil paints which we keep most lit in the evening so it blends in and gives you quite a \"night-light!\"7th... Maybe it's just how I set it up but the sound on mine is lousy, like terrible.  Why no fuss?  I put all sound through external sound devices/amplifiers (using BOSE V-30). IT makes all the difference in the world in your enjoyment experience as well the quality of your immersive experience.  I like to totally get lost in the experience ... sound, music and of course PICTURE!All in all we are pretty delighted with our unit, especially since I made some work a rounds with extra Darbee video processing with the Oppo and using externals units for the extra goodies. With the new H.265 codec created last fall for internet extended compression thus freeing up bandwidth, all steaming devices will require new hardware to handle it so this TV is out of luck unless they make a hardware update available or run two codecs simultaneously.  That's all above my pay grade.I threw away the box and am keeping this fine, fantastic looking, well built (other than the duel-core issue) fair priced beast of an 'eye candy dispenser!' I'm sure as with all electronics their may be improvements in the months and years to come but for the 'here and now' this is the one for us!

Both TV's are nearly identical however this model feels much heavier. The &#34;weight&#34; on both show to be the same but there is significance weight difference.The Picture on these TV's feature the quad leds, most have red, green and blue, this TV features a 4th color, the yellow. Honestly I can't tell much of a difference. The picture IS crystal clear and it is really easy to use.The remote is adequate that the TV comes with. It isn't special. I have had a few TV's that had universal style remotes that you could program to work with other components in your media system, this one is pretty solo as the TV is designed as a &#34;everything&#34; tv with it's built in apps and streaming. Additionally the TV features one cool mode which I have not seen on any other TV's, the ability to convert any 2D show into 3D. It works surprisingly well and is easy to activate.The TV also has a &#34;live wallpaper&#34; mode. After all you have a 60&#34; TV up in your house or on a media stand and when it's off you have a giant black hole where it lives. With the wallpaper mode you can have it cycle through fine works of art in a reduced power mode or show a digital clock. Frankly the clock looks bad, makes it look like a giant computer screen. The fine works of art is really nice although the selection it goes through is limited. I would have loved this TV to download additional photos as it is on the network but I keep seeing the same few pictures.Overall it really is a nice TV, if you aren't going to have it on a stand and instead will hand it I would suggest you go with the LC-60EQ10U model, it's lighter and cheaper and comes with everything the same as far as I can tell. This model on this page shines because of the brushed metal trim around the bezel and the stand.Prior to this I had a LED Vizio 60&#34; TV and that one was good, but compared to the picture of the Sharp Aquos the tv was sub-par, but then again the price tag on the Vizio was approx $800 at the time, this one is much more but you are getting a much crispier, brighter and faster display.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nice TV, if you want brushed metal look go with this, if you won't use the stand get the LC-60EQ10U model and save money", "unixReviewTime": 1404086400, "reviewTime": "06 30, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "ABBJI1H5NI8VE", "asin": "B00I01JQJM", "reviewerName": "Chad", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "Great timing!

I bought these as I was having issues with neighbors and wanted to keep an eye on my house while I was at work and my wife was home with our baby.  For the most this is a great product for the money. But there are some drawbacks.The daytime picture quality is great.  Even on my big screen TV (40 some odd inches is big to me) which I have linked it to in my living room, I can see decent details.  If someone walks to my car about 50 ft. away, I can tell who it is.  I can't read my license plate at that distance, but I knew that when getting these that it wouldn't be able to pick up that kind of detail.  The colors are a little off, green looks more pinkish, but who cares really.  I haven't linked to my phone yet, but I have internet explorer at work and just about everywhere else, which is what you use to stream the video feed online via your router and internet connection.The setup was easy to do as far as setting up online, just follow the instructions online to setup the video feed to stream using your IP address as a web host.  Hooking the cameras up was really easy.  The cables are really thin, so I was able to hide them under siding or under molding without any issues.  If you have to go through a wall, you will need to drill out a 1/2 inch hole though so be prepared for that as the video connection end is about that big.  Just be ready with a small tube of silicone so you don't cause yourself any leaking issues with outside wholes.The only drawback to the entire system so far is the night vision.

I don't mind so much as I wasn't expecting much NV power for the price.  The front camera's that I have setup work fine as there is a street light.  It goes to black and white in low light and I can see pretty good.  Currently I have a monition light over my back door which is where the camera is located, so if someone actually does come up close to the house, the light goes on and I can see them clear as day, but without that motion light, the camera is pretty useless at night.  I also have one of the camera's linked up on a building about 80 ft. from my house looking back up at it, which is great because they watch themselves.  Just purchased 150 ft. of cable for that one to be linked up.All in all I would say your getting exactly what you pay for.

The headphones look as great in person as they do in the photos on Amazon, and they fold nicely into a sturdy case that is provided with purchase of the headphones.

The headphones also come with two sets of cords, one for iPhones and one for Androids, a nice touch that is sure to be appreciated by the consumers owning either of these two phone platforms. As for the sound quality, I have to say I was underwhelmed. After putting the headphones on and plugging them into my iPhone, I started to double check to make sure the chord was connected fully as the music playing seemed to be very distant, as if it was playing in a large empty auditorium. When I realized that the chord was plugged in fully, I was very disappointed, as this is my first experience where an Altec Lansing product didn't exceed my expectations sound quality wise. Increasing the volume helped a bit, but the headphones still pale in comparison to the sound quality I have been getting from a pair of Sony in-ear headphones that are half the price of this offering from Altec. Additionally, I found the earpieces to be rather uncomfortable, and wished that they had fit around the ears in a circular pattern like most other studio headphones do. I'll go with a three star review here because the comfort aspect of the headphones might just be my own personal preference, but I have to say these pale in comparison to the Sennheiser studio headphones I've been using for years in terms of sound quality.

The front camera is only 2MP, which is lower than you typically find now in Android phones.  And most notably, the screen resolution of 1,024 x 768, which is fair but not outstanding.  However, limitations have to be expected on a device that has been designed with the focus on price and function while trying to keep the price down.If you're looking for the perfect table with price not being a concern, then the iPad or a Kindle Fire should be researched.

One thing that I can testify to, however, is that I have never been encouraged by Amazon to give a good or bad review to any of the books or products I've reviewed. Occasionally, I do write a negative review, although I more often give 3 to 5 stars. That's because I tend not to be motivated to review things that I dislike. I will do so in the case of appliances and consumer electronics, however, because I know that other customers depend on honest reviews to guide their purchases.So, having said all that, let me list the 'pros' of the iHome Bluetooth Speaker:- Simple to set up the wireless function, even for novices.- Small size (about 7 inches long by 3.5 inches high. It has a small footprint so will fit on a crowded night stand or counter top.- Good sound. (Not great, but good. More about that below.)- Built-in USB charger for your iPod or other device- Built-in speaker phone. I don't use this, but someone who has a different home office set-up might find it handy. It might also be useful for someone who likes to talk by voice while cooking or doing some other activity.- Comes with a remote control (NFC) and a one-year warranty. This latter is good, as many other manufacturers offer only 90 days.Now I have one con -- This unit has very weak bass. This is a real problem if you listen to music that tends to have strong bass lines -- rock n roll, etc. If, on the other hand, you listen only to classical music or other genres that are strong on treble and low on bass, I believe you will be very happy with this unit.In contrast, I have an Altec Lansing wireless Bluetooth speaker that boasts both a prominent (adjustable) bass, as well as decent highs in the treble range.

Display preferences lists ONLY the native resolution.

(No, it does not help to enable HiDPI with Quartz Debug, nor with the QuickRes &#34;Enable HiDPI&#34; button).  So the menus and all applications are absolutely tiny.You could adjust the size of everything on a per-application basis, but then they won't look right when you're working on the laptop display, unless you use something like QuickRes to run the laptop display at its native resolution.

If that becomes unscrewed (which isn't too hard to do if walking around), the camera itself will drop, whether or not you're using the lockstar. The lockstar prevents the carabiner from opening.If you are more concerned about the camera unthreading itself, look into the Black Rapid Tether Kit.

Very small footprint. This is the only brand I ever found that lets you trigger off one camera off of another for motion detection. For example you might want to turn on a camera around a corner to capture someone as they went from one camera viewpoint to another. I bought this one to support 960H, right now it works fine on my old cameras. Prices have really went down on these things and this one is a bargain with the 1 TB drive.Dealing with their tech support was a pleasure. I had to call them because of an error in their DDNS setup sheet that I was using to setup external viewing on my mobile phone. In the field Domain name they have http:// in front of the domain name, which was wrong, http:// should NOT be typed in the field. Once I just entered the domain name I had set up in their myq-see.com domain service it work great! Also I learned you cannot in any browser configure the masked out area for a camera, that must be only done at the DVR. Once I knew I could not do it, that was fine with me, I just needed to know. I also verified that it will support both 960h and non-960h concurrently which I needed because I will have small hidden invisible led 940nm wavelength 700tvl cameras besides the larger visible red led 960h cameras.In all this was a nice experience.  If you are considering a 4-camera unit, my advice is go with an 8 port with 4 cameras at first as until you get it you don't realize how you eventually want to see more, or you discover holes in your surveillance area.I highly recommend this unit. This is third once I installed, and the second Q-see brand one I installed. To me, I am sticking with Q-see.I want to add that tech support followed up to make sure I was happy and later on they sent a survey on how well they did.

The contents were well packaged and everything was included to install the system.Cameras -  Camera cables were 60 feet in length and were long enough for my application.  The aiming adjustment system for each camera were easy to adjust and makes it where it is easy to aim and will work in virtually any application.  The camera housings are metal, not plastic and seem to be well made and rugged.  The PTZ camera came with an arm mount and a ceiling mount.  The housing was metal and very sturdy.Recorder &#8211; Very easy to set up and get going.  All cables, for different applications, were included.  The instruction  guide was awesome!  It was very easy to read and understand and included screenshots for each step of the way.  The system comes with a mouse so all you had to do is follow along and click.Performance -  Cameras have great coverage with their 59 degree arc with little or no distortion.  Images are very sharp and identifiable.  The IR throws plenty of light out to an advertised distance of 85 feet.  I&#8217;m able to get every bit of that with mine and the image is still nice and sharp.The recording ability is motion activated.  An icon appears on the picture frame of your monitor indication which camera has been activated and is recording.  During testing, the activations triggers quickly, as soon as there is movement in the frame.Playback is a breeze, using the provided mouse and screen icons and menus.The iPhone app works great and it was has novel way to transfer the settings from your DVR to the app... just scan a QR code!  The settings then appear in your app and you're good to go.  The web app worked with IE, Firefox, and Chrome.  Unfortunately, you have to be an admin on the computer to install the web software.  I really wish they had a MJPEG push option for viewing so you could at least see what's going on without having to be an admin.One more picky thing I would improve on is the type of screw they use on  the camera angle adjustment.  It is a very small Phillips head screw.  One of the cameras had this screw tightened down pretty tight and was difficult to get out without stripping the shallow head out.  I think an Allen head screw would work better and less likely to strip out the head is torqued down tight.  Also, an Allen head screw can be tightened more easily and it can be reached more easily in tight spaces or against a wall with an Allen wrench verses a screwdriver.Overall I am more than please with the system, its capabilities and performance.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Nearly perfect security camera system!", "unixReviewTime": 1403049600, "reviewTime": "06 18, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A3BPK472YL7N58", "asin": "B00I2N6O20", "reviewerName": "Lyle", "helpful": [6, 7], "reviewText": "My older DVR would not allow me to access my DVR with my computer over my wireless N home system.

For several years I have been running a Netgear ReadyNAS Ultra4+ with, currently, four WD Red 2TB drives which are specially designed for NAS boxes. So it was a delight to see that WD used its own Red drives in the WD My CLoud EX2 - two 2TB drives.While this is advertised as a 4TB NAS, you'd get that much storage only if you configured the NAS as \"RAID0\", which has no redundancy for data safety. Unlike some other NAS boxes I've tried, such as theBuffalo LinkStation 420, WD appropriately ships the My Cloud EX2 configured for \"RAID1\", which mirrors the drives for redundancy, but dropping the usable capacity to 2TB. You can switch the WD to RAID0 if you want (as the Buffalo can be switched to RAID1), but I give props to WD for choosing safety as the default.Unlike the Buffalo, the WD My Cloud EX2 was very easy to set up - I downloaded the configuration utility which found the NAS on my network and set it up automatically. The control panel is easy to use with large and clear displays of status and control of features. And, wow, what a lot of features there are! I'm not going to attempt to list them all, but here are some of the things that caught my eye:- Distributed File System and Active Directory support- SSH root access supported (but if you mess things up, it's on your head)- DLNA and Apple iTunes server- The ability to mount an ISO image file on your network and serve it as a diskThere are several \"apps\" built in, including a somewhat old but serviceable version of the Transmission BitTorrent client. There are also a bunch of apps you can install from WD's web site and there are others you can find in a user forum for the line.Performance was right in line with my other NAS boxes, about 60MB/sec on a gigabit Ethernet network.WD also provides mobile apps for accessing your My Cloud box, and unlike Buffalo's, I found this easy to set up. I did miss, though, the ability to automatically upload photos from my iPhone's camera roll, something Buffalo's app does. You can do this manually, however. The apps interface through WD's MyCloud web service, and as I write this, that service had been down for many users for an extended time. It seems to be fine now, though, and I never saw an issue when I tried it.If you want to upgrade disks, you'll need to replace both at once, something that is nearly universal with two-disk NAS boxes. My four-disk ReadyNAS allows one-at-a-time upgrades. If you upgrade the WD, you'll need to do a full backup and restore of your data. WD offers a backup utility, but I didn't try it.Other than it being only a two-disk box, which precludes easy upgrades, I really like the WD My Cloud EX2. It's the best of the two-disk NAS boxes I've used (which is now three of them over the years.) That WD uses its own NAS-rated Red drives is a big plus in my book.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Well-designed, competent, feature-full and easy to use", "unixReviewTime": 1398556800, "reviewTime": "04 27, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A1FX0WGVU5O53B", "asin": "B00I2VIR2M", "reviewerName": "airbornemp108 \"John\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "This package works great with my Hero 3+.

Simply because I haven't seen iPad Minis deployed in those kinds of contexts. The Mini is really a consumption device, first and last, and is operated more comfortably without a large case. This case definitely changes the user experience (not in a good way in my opinion).

Using four attachment nodes (&#34;accessory nodes&#34;), you can add straps, stands, and so on as you need.The case came with a couple of straps - a shoulder strap, a wrist strap, and a hand strap. The first two work as you might expect. The hand strap can be attached diagonally or straight. The straight fit seemed more comfortable. It's a very useful feature, but the strap itself could have been made of a more comfy material - it's a little &#34;scratchy&#34; if you have dry hands.The case system is minimalistic and light, providing shock protection. It's a little hard, though, to switch it from open to closed, as you have to pry the case off a bit.

I consider myself pretty open-minded, so I've been trying to figure out how I can use this--and, yes, it does seem weird to me as a casual though frequent but static user (meaning I stay in one place, for the most part, when I'm using it).ModulR says it's made for mobility. They call the product a &#34;mobility system&#34; in the included brochure, and this pack itself is described as a &#34;mini mobility pack.&#34; So, first off, I use my iPad a lot around the office and at home. I happen to like the non-slick feel of my leather-bound iPad cover with integrated handle--makes it easy to hold with one hand or two, and in all positions: sitting, lying down, even walking around over short distances. For my purposes, I don't like the ModulR's slick feel.I can see where the mobility system has uses when you're out and on-the-go. And that's what they're after...after all. The shipped product includes a shoulder strap, a wrist strap, and a hand strap. The first two obviously help you carry it around without holding it when you're moving from place to place--whether for work or play (think touring around a city and using your iPad to access travel info and to take photos). That's where I think it would really work well. As for the hand strap, well, one of the weakness of this product, I think, is that it's somewhat slick and difficult to hold securely unless your hands are sweaty and clammy.As for using the high-comfort case at home and the ModulR case while on the go, I think it's a hassle to change from one case to another.I'm going to leave it at that in terms of casual use.Where I think ModulR may have something here is in presenting a mobility solution not for the casual user but rather for the worker who uses an iPad as a regular part of his or her job. Maybe someone is moving around a factory and entering data or scanning/photographing bar codes or objects. Maybe someone is walking around taking orders at a busy restaurant and needs to have hands free for other tasks at times (then you use the shoulder or wrist strap, for example).This seems to be a new concept. Let's see how it plays out and whether ModulR can make something of it. I think the possibilities may be limited for the iPad mini version. The only accessories they sell for that, as far as I can tell, are a storage/viewing stand and a hip/shoulder pouch. For the full-sized version, there's a swing mount, a swing mount with lock, a wall mount, a car headrest strap (for use in the seat behind the headrest), a &#34;quick stand,&#34; a &#34;utility glove,&#34; a &#34;hip holster/shoulder pouch,&#34; and a shoulder strap.

Then the top part clicks into place over the bottom, keeping the iPad secure but adding little additional weight.  The different straps (several are included) easily snap onto the various ports on the case, so you can carry the iPad in a variety of ways (by hand, by wrist, or by shoulder).But . . . and it's a big but . . . the case itself does not flip open.  In fact, it's fairly difficult to remove the cover so you can actually use the iPad - you definitely need two hands to do it, and even then, it's an awkward process.  And once the top part of the case is off, you have snap it onto the bottom of the iPad, and then unsnap it again when you want to close the thing up.

I just cannot maneuver cameras as well without a bottom grip, and I shoot nearly a 50-50 split of horizontal and vertical shots--sometimes even more vertical depending on the subject of course (portraits, bridals, basketball). I pre-ordered the battery grip at the same time as the body, because I knew I would just have to have it to work well for me ergonomically.It isn't cheap. I mean that both ways: The price is kinda high for what it is, we all know that. Camera companies probably make more money on accessories than the actual bodies anyway. Lenses, grips, batteries. But it isn't cheaply-made either. It seems solid. The fit is just perfect on my X-T1. You need to take off a plastic cover over the contacts on grip(20!)and the rubber gasket over the contacts on the body and put the rubber cover into a recessed hole in the grip, align two strong pins on the edge of the grip that go into the body's bottom plate, then screw it down onto the camera. Easy enough.There is a leathery-covering over the top plate of the grip. It something I haven't seen much of on other grips, but it looks nice for the 10 seconds you see it before attaching to your camera. And I do believe it may be functional. The very assuring way the grip aligns with the body as the grip is mounted is nice. There are NO squeaks once the two parts are perfectly joined. The grip does not ever feel loose or move around any. It's just the way it should be.It does LOOK a bit big for what it is--which makes the camera look even more like a DSLR. That could be good or bad, certainly makes it taller, but its pretty slim (the cameras girth in general is much less than a DSLR). I wonder if there is extra space inside there, if there was some way they might have been able to fit TWO batteries in the grip (would probably be nice for extended shooting) but I don't think it would work. The battery kinda slides into the grip at an angle strangely, but its of no concern at all, just different.You keep one battery in the camera body. I chose to keep the battery I got with the camera inside the body, making sure it was fully charged first. With all my grip-enabled cameras, I try to just use the body battery as necessity, not for general shooting--'cause its a bit of a pain to unscrew and dismount the grip to change out the battery in the camera. But it is easy to change the battery in the grip. There is a little slide release that opens the door on the left side (from shooter's position) of the grip/camera. You have to slide it BACK into position, there is no spring-loading--just like the battery cover on the camera. There is a spring-loaded clip inside, that holds battery in position, also just like the camera.The controls work well. They basically duplicate what is on the camera. From top (vertically-arranged on the left) Focus Assist (abbreviated \"F.A.\"), AE-L, and AF-L. Above and to the right is the selector wheel. All the buttons and the wheel look and feel exactly as the ones on the body. The SHUTTER  RELEASE is also very similar. Same size and pressure-release sensitivity. There is a lock ring around the shutter button that mimics the ON-OFF switch on the camera. It of course just locks the release, does not power the camera on/off. The shutter seems almost the same trigger-feel as the body shutter release--maybe just a tad bit harder or longer (I may be imagining it)--it's so close you will not worry about it. And maybe I just need to shoot with it more and loosen it up a bit.The grip on the camera FITS my hand very nicely. It feels solid, makes holding the camera in either position (H or V) more comfortable and grip-able (yea, that's what its for, huh?)I think your hand rests even less on the selector dials on the camera with the grip attached (the D-pad that is too recessed making it hard to maneuver--hmm, maybe they shoulda just designed a built-in vertical grip that was slightly smaller and then made the D-pad on the camera work better!).That's about it really. I'm sure if you are reading this you already figured most of this out, but I hope it was helpful anyway.I have already shot some product shots that I will attach here with the review or on the X-T1 body review. Maybe they will be helpful for SIZE COMPARISON, as many might like to see how the camera compares to a few others in terms of size.Thanks for reading ;)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Makes the FujiFilm X-T1 even more DSLR-like...  ;) or :(", "unixReviewTime": 1394409600, "reviewTime": "03 10, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "AYS4UGU2YB0W4", "asin": "B00I45GT3A", "reviewerName": "Dennis Meek", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "The Razor Adaro Stereos &#8211; Analog headphones are comfortable with great sound quality and a sturdy build.

I've been wearing these at work for 8-hour stretches, and I pretty much forget they're on my head; big plus in my book.These don't lack in the sound department for this pricepoint, either.  They're a tad lacking in the treble department, but nothing that will bust the deal.  I listen to primarily electronic music, but I've also listened to classical, jazz, rock, and hip hop, and all sound more than serviceable in the power department.  I use these headphones with an iPhone 4, so whatever device you use will determine the playback a little, but if you plan on using these with an iPhone you won't be disappointed.I also like the neon green cord!

The X5 is a solid DAP. If you like the Fiio house sound, the X5 will delight you. It has some great festures like dual mSD slots and a good UI. The Texas Instruments DAC provides great instrument placement on the sound stage too. The onboard amp didn&#8217;t wow me. It is solid and certainly acceptable, but it seemed too warm for me, with some bass bleeding into the low mids. Overall, it&#8217;s a good DAP, but I prefer a different sound sig from me equipment.My context: I use my DAP&#8217;s primarily at work, or while working around the house. I want a DAP that&#8217;s small enough to comfortably fit in my pocket, and is easy to use without looking at (mostly meaning change the song, pause, and adjust volume while its in my pocket). Up to this point I have been using the iBasso DX50 with a C&C; BH2 into Vmoda M100&#8217;s.My Music: I did the testing with about 60% FLAC, 30% 320 mp3&#8217;s and 10% 128-256 mp3&#8217;s. I included the low rez files because I have some legacy music that I cant/don&#8217;t want to pay to replace and was interested how it would do with low bitrate files, but these were not factored into how I think the X5 sounds. I only tested one 24/96 album and no 24/192, as I hear no improvement from super hi-rez music.Ergonomics:Looks: Personally, I think this thing is ugly. I heard someone compare it to a 90&#8217;s Aiwa CD player, and I totally agree. I guess they were going for a turn table appearance, but it doesn&#8217;t really work for me. This is fairly unimportant though. Also, for those of you that are going to rubber band an amp to it, there is very little room between the screen and the wheel for the rubber band, and it gets in the way a little bit. You may be better off cutting out a square from the back of the silicone case and Velcro-ing your amp to it.The Wheel: Personally, I am not a big fan of the wheel for navigation. The wheel seems solid enough, but I have concerns that small particules (sand/lint/grit) could possibly become wedged between the wheel and casing, or possibly get underneath it since the wheel physically spins, unlike an Ipod which is stationary. I work in a machine shop where micro sized metal chips are common. I could see one getting wedged in the wheel at some point, although this was not an issue at all on my unit. I&#8217;m just thinking if you&#8217;re taking this around to less clean environments, it may be an issue. Other than the wheel itself, I thought it took a long time to scroll through long lists. I only have around 50 albums on my SD card, but it took quite a while to get to the bottom, so those of you with large directory lists will get a good thumb workout.UI: I&#8217;ve been spoiled by a touchscreen for a while now, and going back to the wheel took some getting used to. Navigating the UI will get easier with time I&#8217;m sure, but I was not a big fan of it. It is fairly slow to get back to the Now Playing screen to change the song when you&#8217;re in the menu. Using the EQ with the scroll wheel is also somewhat tedious, but once it&#8217;s set you don&#8217;t really adjust it much, so I don&#8217;t foresee this as a big issue. Besides the interface, I like all the options included in the UI. It had some handy ones that the DX50 does not, like &#8220;power on volume&#8221;, left/right balance, and an integrated instruction manual. These are all great features.Another big plus for the X5 is a properly working random play, meaning; Next Track button plays a random song, Previous Track plays the last track that was played. On the DX50, the Last Track button goes to the song immediately behind the current file in the directory, not the last track played. This drives me nuts! Another feature I like more than the DX50 is the FF/RW function. It skips ahead at a good rate with minimal delay. The DX50 FF/RW is overly slow, and its much more useful just to poke at the progress bar until you get the time in the song you&#8217;re looking for.Timeout: The X5 only has a 8 minute maximum time out/shutoff which I thought was too short. I commonly get interrupted at work for more than 8 minutes, but less than 15 or 20. I have my Dx50 set to timeout after 20 mins, and don&#8217;t have to turn it back on frequently. With the 8 minute limit on the X5, I was turning it back on frequently, which was kinda annoying.Silicone case: If you change cards a lot you&#8217;ll want to note: the silicone case covers the card slots, so you&#8217;ll either be taking the case on and off a lot, or you&#8217;ll want to cut out slots for the cards. Also, if you&#8217;re going to use it Amped all the time, the silicone case has 2 little tabs that cover the LO and Coax out which kinda get in the way. I would cut them off and just buy the silicone 3.5mm plugs to cover the unused HO/LO/Coax ports.Play: there is a couple second pause between pushing the play/pause button and the player responding. Its about the same as on the DX50. The power up is slightly faster than the DX50 though. I like the menu option that allows you to choose how/if it resumes play where you left off.Weight/size: noticeably heaver than the DX50. Not massive by any means, but its substantial. Its boarder line of too big, but hasn&#8217;t quite crossed into that territory yet. Without an amp, its fine; with an amp, its pretty big and no longer portable IMO. It becomes closer to a portable desktop rig.Volume/Power: I used my M100&#8217;s for most of the testing, but also used Phillips Stretch headphones for a small comparison. I used High gain at around 35-50 volume. 40-45 was loud but comfortable. The M100&#8217;s are exceptionally easy to drive, so I cant really comment about the X5&#8217;s ability to drive 250-300 ohm headphones. One thing I like a lot more on the DX50 is that the Volume + and &#8211; buttons are separated by a quarter inch. On the X5 they are each half of &#8220;1&#8221; long button. I like the DX50&#8217;s 2 distinct buttons because they are easier to feel through your pants and easier to adjust without looking at the player.Now, on the the important part: The Sound.Do not have a large palette of high end DAPs to compare this to, mostly just the DX50, but have used Ipods, Sansa Clip+, Creative Zen, Zune, and the X3. For my comparison, I did No EQing to best compare one to the other (I mean, EQ off).First off, I think the Texas Instruments DAC does a good job of imaging and instrument separation. Most of the time I thought this was a plus, but in some recordings, it made the sound stage too wide or localized. I specifically thought that the guitar and drums on Dave Matthew&#8217;s Lie in our Graves were almost too localized.To me, the general signature of this DAP seems to be strong lows and mids, laid back highs. By that I mean the bass and mids stand out, with the treble taking a back seat. Sub bass ( &#60;40hz) wasn&#8217;t as strong either.To my ears, the Lows on the X5 are boosted. They seem more present than on my DX50. This really comes through with things like a bass guitar, and the lower notes metal guitars with distortion. I think I heard the upper lows bleeding into the lower mids on a lot of rock songs like Godsmack&#8217;s Bad Religion, Weezer&#8217;s Pork and Beans, and Disturbed&#8217;s Voices.The Mid&#8217;s also seem very prominent to me. The vocals come across very nicely in general with a good, natural sound. Once thing I noticed: there is a certain frequency in some rock songs, a medium-high guitar note, that really pierces and seems overly loud. I noticed this in some of the rock songs mentioned above, and specifically in Korn&#8217;s Reclaim My Place.The Highs could use a little EQing up in my opinion, but I think this about most setups. I did about the same boost with my DX50 and got both players to sound about the same.I did some testing with the C&C; BH2 and the Fiio E12 via the LO too. I thought both the E12 and BH2 provided a better (to my ears) sound sig than the onboard amp. It seemed flatter/more neutral in general. The prominent lows and mids via the HO seemed to be more even via the LO to either amp. Comparing the LO of the DX50 to the X5, I highly doubt I would be able to tell one from the other in a blind test. 1 thing I do like about the DX50, is that the LO volume is variable. I know people go both ways on this, but I personally like it because I have sensitive headphones. With the X5, I could only use around  to 1/3 of the volume knob before it became too loud, and when in a very quiet environment, I only needed 1/6 to 1/8 volume. On the DX50, I set my LO volume to 230/255 and then I can use  of the volume knob. I know that technically you want the highest source voltage and lowest amp gain for the best THD ratio, but I still cant hear distortion using it like this. If you have higher impedance headphones, this wont be an issue, as you need more power to achieve the same volume. Overall the LO on the X5 is very good and clean. It will be a great source for any amp you strap on it.Final thoughts: The X5 is a solid player. Personally, I like my DX50/BH2 combo better at the same price point. I think the X5 has the &#8220;Fiio house sound&#8221;, and the people who like that will love the X5. I chose the DX50 after my co worker had me listen to the X3 and DX50. I instantly liked the DX50 more and have been in the iBasso camp ever since. I know lots of people like the Fiio sound though, so if you have liked their players in the past, im sure you&#8217;ll love the X5, especially if you&#8217;re coming from an X3.

Just connect it to the cable in port on your HDTV, hang it up (you can lie it flat too) and do a channel search on 'air'. I can get 14 channels in the rural area I live and this antenna picked up 13; one is just out of range.  As with all the flat antennas, placement is key to successful use.  I powered the amplifier by the included AC adapter (connect the USB to the AC adapter), but you can easily power it via a USB port on your HDTV too.  NOTE:  I find that by using the constant AC power I have to do channel scans and auto tuning less frequently than when I use the USB port.As expected this antenna picked up all but one channel that was simply out of range for this antenna to pick it up.  NOTE:  Be sure that when comparing antennas to take special note of their range, as I've found them to be quite accurate.I pick up all the HD over-air channels (digital) and standard definition over-air that are available in my area with this antenna.  I'm sold on the 'amped' versions versus the non-amplified ones, as I think they provide a more reliable signal.I've yet to discover a flat antenna that doesn't do the job better than the old rabbit ear-type antennas, but be aware that your success with these antennas (Mohu, AmazonBasics and Winegard brands) will depend upon the following factors.1. Your location in relationship to the TV towers in your area.  You have to be within range of the towers to receive the signals, and the antenna you choose must have the power to reach out and grab those signals to send to the digital tuner in your HDTV.2. Placement of your antenna is key to gaining consistent quality signals and all the channels that are available.  Take the time to figure out what works best in your location.  Tall buildings, trees, mountains, the building you are in and tower location will all factor in.  NOTE:  If you live in a city, you may be able to get lots more channels than in a rural area, but the quality of those channels may still be affected by the previously mentioned factors.You need to do a monthly channel auto-search and save to get the best reception. Weather can affect over-air channels, so be aware that the reception you get may be pixelated or unavailable at times when cable is not.You CAN cut out cable TV bills by using this antenna.  I cut the cable cord and now use flat antennas (both Winegard and Mohu products...) to save $80 a month.  I use flat antennas for network channels and supplement with Amazon Instant Video, Netflix, Hulu Plus and other channels off Roku and Apple TV devices.I'm impressed with this USA made FlatWave Amped.  It's not very big, can be hidden behind a curtain or wall hanging, and has a generous 18.5' cable length.  It works as expected, is well constructed and comes with clear directions.  If it's priced right, don't hesitate to snap one up for your home, office or travel trailer.TIP:  If you want to hide the cable that's attached to your antenna, consider getting a paintable cable management system that can be adhered to your drywall.  About twenty bucks for around 12' seems to be the going price.UPDATE: 4/23/14I received so many questions about how to use flat antennas and get free over-the-air TV that I wrote a book on it.Simple Guide to Over-the-Air Free TVshows you how to setup your flat antenna, what to expect from cord cutting, how to supplement with streaming media and more.

This camera is a Point & Shoot so is not the cameras I will be relaying on, but its still a serious camera.As a pro photographer I'm not going into the camera specs or comparisons - you can get specs elsewhere for the pixel peepers as well as detailed reviews here. I am just going to give you my impressions of \"feel & quality\".Coming from a G11 this thing is much heavier and is not a \"pants pocket\" camera. Too big and too heavy, my pants would be around my ankles within an hour!! It feels really well made and will probably come close to DSLR image quality and it has features my Nikons don't. Well a lot happens in a couple of years.I bought it as the G11 was getting a bit long in the tooth and I was never happy with its noise levels or a 28mm wide on the lens. This camera is better at 800 ISO than the G11 at 100 ISO  and has a 24mm W/A lens. And that's what I really wanted. Try looking and see what you can find - not many.Handling: I have  problem with my left hand as I want to place my forefinger on top of the flash. OK if you don't use flash which I would avoid anyway preferring to let the camera set the ISO it needs. My Nikons I always shoot in Manual mode but this Canon will be in Auto for what it is used for. It seems to try to keep the ISO as low as possible. In fact you can limit the ISO highest number.I'll add more after 2 weeks of travel and use.Oh, one important thing I nearly forgot - I cannot connect this camera to my Samsung phone running 4.1.1. Speaking to Canon USA today they say the Apps will catch up but that should have been dealt with prior to the camera launch. It connects to an iPhone but who uses those!!!! Uhm....Just back from a 2 week photo trip in the South West and used this camera as a backup and point and shoot grab camera. First noticed that the screen is very hard to see in the outdoors or in sunshine. It needs the viewfinder to overcome those points - now we are getting into serious money. Picture quality/exposure is very good however. Camera feels to have sharp corners here and there. Also don't like the fact the rear view screen cannot be turned in to prevent scratching it. That screen when set to touch mode I found I was shooting many a picture not intended.It meets my purposes with its 24mm lens but may not be for everybody.

Sony has the most zoom in a pocketable package and a ton of megapixels on a reasonably large sensor. Fujifilm has true pocket ability, a bright lens, and astounding color rendering. Canon's G1x seemed to be a one-trick pony with its larger size due to the better glass hung on the front. And even that was compromised in the Mk 1.The lens on this model is a total redesign. In fact, the whole camera is a redesign from the G1x. It gets different dimensions in every angle. It gets a bigger sensor with much bigger pixels for astounding light and color performance. It gets Digic 6 and a faster chip, and improved wireless image transfer capability.I went without the G1x because it suffered from some critical flaws in its basic design that made me a Fujifilm customer. But I was really missing that big Canon lens-sensor combo for outdoor and architectural photos. When I sold my X100 (for a premium price, natch) I got what many would consider a lesser camera in the G1x ii.I guess in most ways I disagree. I get a lot of shots with the Canon that I was missing with the X100 because I was futzing with the controls to get the settings right. The G1x let's me get set up for each shot in a tiny fraction of the time it takes to set up the X100. I found I was actually using the auto mode in the X100 to get people shots I would otherwise miss. Thank goodness the auto mode is very good on that camera.With the extra physical controls on the G1x, I can set up a shot very quickly for exposure, depth of field, bracketing etc. in a minimum number of steps. Meaning I don't miss the shot as much. Yes, the camera is bigger. No, I won't pop for a $300 EVF. I don't know if anybody mentioned this, but the industrial design and proportions of this chunky camera are sweet. It's a good looker, with each control designed to look great and perform well.It competes well in image quality with my last point and shoot, and tackles framing better. Skin tone rendering is very nice, though I must say the X100 is quite a bit better in that regard, particularly in low light. I do like the bounceable flash. The lens barrel bayonet mount is a bit hokey and doesn't hold much. Thankfully the most used filter, the ND, is built in and can be switched on or off in 3 clicks.Feels very good in the hands. Well made, tough.Kind of a travel cam. A little large to carry around all the time. I just use the iphone for quick shots now.

It is pretty different from its predecessor, but it is exactly what I'v been looking for. For years I was switching between a number of Nikon DSLR's like D300s, D700, D7000, and some smaller ones, and after that some promissing Panasonic G3, G5, and with each model I was buying a good zoom lens with the equivalent range about 28 - 75 mm and apperture F/2.8. I was very satisfied with the picture quality of all those nice cameras, but the problem was - because of their size I could not keep them with me on the every-day basis. This new G1X-II has all the qualities which I tried to achieve with my other purchases, and in particular:- About Micro-4/3 sized high-sensitivity CMOS sensor.- Wide variety of the image aspect ratios: 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 16:9, and a rare but useful 4:5.- The sensor geometry provides almost the same vertical angle of view for ratios 1:1, 4:3 and 3:2.- Huge ISO range from 100 up to 12800 (still good for Internet uploads).- A high-quality zoom lens 24 - 120 mm (35mm equiv.) with optical image stabilization.- The incredibly bright aperture F/2.0 - F/3.9 in the zoom range, and 9-blade diaphragm for nice bokeh.- Quick and reliable auto focus system with 2-angle AF-assist light beam (for close and far subjects).- Hot-shoe for external flash.- Recent DIGIC6 processor for high-quality images and sophisticated noise reduction at high ISO's.- High resolution 1MP titling display.- Good quality Full HD 30p video with working zoom and continuous autofocus.- Relatively small size to put it into my outwear-jacket's pocket.SAMPLE_PICTURES: I've uploaded some sample pictures but Amazon does not allow the external links in the text of the review itself, however they don't mind them in comments. So I put a link to the sample pictures in the most first my comment to this review.AUTO_FOCUS: I wish this camera would be a Holy Grail for me, but at my first portraiture session I bumped into the problem I less expected - auto-focus failures. I've missed many nice shots because when I was half-pressing the shutter button to lock a focus on humans' faces, it was rejected by giving me a yellow (instead of green) focus-area rectangle with the exclamation mark. Along with the focus-rejection cases there were also many other ones where I could take a shot but when viewing them on a big screen I could admit the focus was actually locked on something behind while the entire human face with the eyes was blurred. With all my former DSLR and P&S; cameras (Nikon, Sony, Panasonic) I never had such problem before, so I was totally confused.While analyzing such cases later I got an idea that might happen when behind the relatively low-contrast human face there was something more contrast, what could attract the AF attention - that could be a book-shelf, a painting on a wall, even that person's hear... for example if a girl or a young woman (with no wrinkles on the face) has a pony-tail and turn her head a little bit so that pony-tail is visible, the camera easily locks the focus on that relatively-contrast volume of hear with threads instead of the face itself. Or what happened even more frequently - it could not lock the focus at all making the entire shooting impossible (yellow focus rectangle with the exclamation mark).The worst thing is you don't have any control over that strange AF behaviour. You only have a choice between a medium size center focussing area and the face-identifying mode. However from my experience with many other cameras the latter one might be only good on the P&S; cameras with long DOF, while for the big-sensor cameras that face-mode does not garantee the eyes would be in focus - it might focus on something else like teeth or hear. So for that session I chose the center-area focussing. When I was shooting portraits with my other DSLR's I always selected 1-point mode and aimed that area to the nearest human's eye - so my pictures always had a perfect focus. The similar way, a number of Canon P&S; cameras have a choice between medium- and small-size focus area, however this model somehow has no such choice - only mid-size one.However even you switch to the face-focussing mode it will not solve all the problems. I've found it works good only if a person looks strait to the camera and there is nothing on the top of their head or around it - if there is a hat, or a cap, or something like kerchief, headscarf, or shawl - most of the time camera cannot recognize such a face. It's also a problem if a person turned their head so not the full face is visible... etc.And finally - Manual Focus - it was not fun using it. A while ago when I was shooting with my film cameras, I was holding a camera with my right hand and turning the focus ring right-and-left with my left hand. It was enough to turn that ring just 20 degrees right-and-left to easily find the point somewhere in the middle with the best focus. Since my hand can make maximum ring rotation about 30 degrees without changing the grip, all the time when I was adjusting the focus the camear was held with my both arms and so the picture in the viewfinder was stable and the entire focus-finding process was pretty quick.However in this model in order to see the same difference between good and bad focus I have to rotate the manual focus ring 3-4 times more, what leads to the 2 consequences:1) Since with one my hand I can rotate that ring maximum about 30 degrees at one attempt, it needs several repetitive steps to rotate to left and then the same to right, and do it probably several times to see the difference in sharpness and therefore to find the central sharp point. The problem is - nobody can wait for so long time while I'm playing with my camera - the most valuable in humans' portraits are their faces' expressions which spark and fade, and no one can keep it for more than 1-2 sec. So if you cannot take a shot immediately - you lose it.2) Since the focus-finding process becomes a several-steps process, where you have to rotate the focus ring, change the grip, rotate again, and so on - that changing the grip makes the camera shaking, and since in MF mode the central area is additionaly magnified, the image on the screen is shaking pretty much what makes the finding a good focus even more difficult and even more time-consuming.BTW, along with this G1X mark II, I've recently purchased another new Canon travel-zoom camera SX700. What they have in common - the recent DIGIC6 processor, and I realized, when I was shooting some samples pictures with that SX700 I also experienced a number of cases when camera was not able to lock the focus. One of the sceen examples - I tried to take a shot of a single magnolia flower with a bunch of branches behind - most of the times it worked, but sometimes the camera denied to focus on such subject at all, but it did not happen that frequently as with G1X mk II.Generally speaking this G1X mk II is a very good camera in most aspects, while the above mentioned auto-focus issue, which happens on some shooting scenarios, from my prospective is a completely software problem which could be fixed with a firmware update if Canon would be willing to do it for this model.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "BEST OF BOTH WORLDS - BUT AUTO-FOCUS", "unixReviewTime": 1397520000, "reviewTime": "04 15, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A2LAQ09BOEYPVL", "asin": "B00I58M1VK", "reviewerName": "Thomas McLean \"absit iniuria verbis.

I would have been very happy with all the new Mark II updates in the Mark I body but I really like the Mark II as is also. It is a really great camera.I gave 4 stars because of secondary grip as add-on. Cost $35 including shipping. It's better but not quite as good as the Mark I. Also the new battery. I have ammassed and spent a small fortune on Canon's batteries alone and here we go again.I did not deduct a star for the separate EVF. The tunnel in the Mark I was useless and I used the screen 100%.Update5/10/2014I have used the camera quite a bit and really like it. Picture quality is first class. The bigger grip was a must for me and made the camera much more secure in my stubby fingers. I switched back to the original one just to see if the change was real and I wasn't just getting used to the camera. Sure enough, I had to go back to the bigger grip to get that comfortable feel.I love the fact the lens has blades that open and close. This is a big plus and helps keep dust out. However, I'm conscious of anything pushing the blades and damaging them so I added a filter (B+W 58mm XS-Pro Clear UV Haze with Multi-Resistant Nano Coating (010M)-incredible filter btw) and lens cap. You need to buy the adaptor to add the filter and the adaptor works really nice. Combo works great. I know it increases the bulk of the camera a bit, but this isn't a S120. It is over that threshold of not fitting comfortably in a shirt pocket or or even trouser pocket. Can't use Lens hood at the same time but it is really easy to swap them. The lens hood fits really well on the camera.I really like the touch screen for a number of reasons. Main one is I can get tracking autofocus by touching on what I want to be in focus (assuming you have the the right focus mode set in the Menu. It is fast and very convenient. A big improvement over the Mark I.WiFi is growing on me and I like being able to send photos to my phone and e-mail them instantly. I also like that I gan geotag using my phone. Can't help but think that an $800 flagship camera should have geotagging built in (all iPhones do). 1080P @ 60 Hz is missed but only a little. I take pictures 99% per cent of the time and can live with 30 Hz.....for now.This is a solid upgrade to the Mark I in almost every way....maybe the screen movement being the biggest negative (but the touch screen aspect is vastly superior).The market place has unbelievable choices and the competition is fierce. Other cameras have great features and produce great photos. For me, the Mark II gives me what I'm looking for and I'm very happy with my choice. I have owned all Canon G series from the G10 to G16 all the S series from the S90 to S120, numerous olympus cameras and several Nikon DSRLs. The G1X is a joy to use and produces awesome pictures.

The good news is that sx700 appears to be what the 280 was supposed to be and more, with better quality and no evidence of the same video/auto shut off problems that plagued the 280.I'm hopefully optimistic.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fantastic so far.", "unixReviewTime": 1398729600, "reviewTime": "04 29, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A2JE071UW97J2A", "asin": "B00I58M26Y", "reviewerName": "Kenneth Depree", "helpful": [4, 4], "reviewText": "This is not my first camera; I have several, including a Canon 60D with several lenses which I no longer use very much despite it being much more expensive.The SX700, like the SX280 previously, is my walk-around and travel camera.Although I was quite pleased with the SX280, for both photos and video, I upgraded for 2 reasons:(a) the ability to shoot video by the press of a button rather than  having to turn a dial is a huge plus for me.  I shoot both video and photos and have lost a number that I would very much have liked to have because of the time it took to turn the dial and then setup and refocus.  With the SX700, I can switch between photos and video in a fraction of a second.(b) the longer zoom.  The 20X zoom on the SX280 was good, the 30X on the SX700 is even better and gives me better photos of distant objects.To give some perspective, here is a comparison of the maximum focal length with my 60D using a 70-300mm lens, the SX280 I had previously and the SX700.  Testing the 3 cameras shooting a distant object, the focal length with the 70-300 lens was 70 mm, the SX280 with the lens zoomed out was 90 mm, and the focal length with the SX700 zoomed out was 135 mm, almost double the best I could do with the far more expensive 60D and 70-300 mm lens.Suppose for illustration I am shooting a landscape scene where I not interested in a particular object, but in the scene.  I would do well with the 60D, but I can also do well with SX700 by not zooming out the full distance.But suppose there is a distant bear in the landscape that I want to get a photo of.  With the 60D and 70-300 lens, the bear is going to be very small in relation to the surround landscape.  However, with the lens of the SX700 zoomed out, the bear will be at least twice a big.  Less landscape, but much more bear; and it was the bear that I wanted the photo of, not all the landscape.That distant bear will also be noticeably larger if shot with the SX700 rather than the SX280.So I have an expensive dslr with lenses that now I almost never use.  With the SX700, I am getting very good photos and video, it is always ready to shoot both close ups and distant object, no lens change necessary, and it is light weight and easy to carry.The best camera, of course, is the one you have with you.  Given the quality of the photos and video I am shooting with the SX700, the effectiveness of the image stabilization, and the camera's portability, I don't hesitate to take the SX700 when going out for the day or traveling.  Whenever I leave the house, it is in is case on my belt, ready for use.PS:  I would like to say a little more about the image stabilization.  I used to think that it was necessary to have a view finder in order to get sharp shots because with the view finder the camera is better supported.  You can use both hands and press the camera against your forehead to hold it steady.  I almost never used the screen to focus if the camera had a view finder.  However, with the SX700 there is no choice, you must use the screen.  So I hold the camera in both hands, raise my hands and bend my elbows and look at the screen to line up my shot.  I can see the screen fine, but I can also see that the camera is not being held rock steady.  However, when I look at the resulting shot, even those taken with the lens fully zoomed out, I see no evidence of the camera shake that I know existed.  Really amazing, my expensive 60D doesn't do any better even though I am using the viewfinder and holding the camera steady against my head.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Upgrade From Canon SX280; Very Effective Image Stabilization", "unixReviewTime": 1404604800, "reviewTime": "07 6, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A2L0F2T1DLTNT8", "asin": "B00I59VBH4", "reviewerName": "A. Abrams \"Vermonter\"", "helpful": [7, 11], "reviewText": "The AmazonBasics Bluetooth 4.0 Audio Receiver is an analog Bluetooth device. It comes with a Mini-audio plug on one end for output and RCA audio connectors (on the audio-in) for the device you are outputting into.Since many devices now use the mini-stereo plugs, you may need to purchase one of these to allow this device to connect to those devices not having any RCA connection input.I had one available, but, you can buy Amazon's as well for under $7. (AmazonBasics 3.5 mm Coiled Stereo Audio Cable Stretched Length 6.5 feet/2.0 Meters).If your audio listening device has only digital-input, then the conversion game to use this Amazon-Basics Bluetooth adapter gets a little more pricey since now you must go purchase a digital to analog adapter to get the audio into your digital-only device.in this case, the cost factor to convert would make it not worth buying the Amazon Basics device since there's other products out there for digital (only) audio devices.Analog can sound great and I can vouch that if the audio is inputted through this Amazon device to a very good audio source (Home Theater receiver, good shelf system, higher-end sound-bar,  or similar full-sound system), the quality of sound will be excellent. If it's used w/ a lower end or very small speaker system, you certainly won't expect to hear any better sound then what that small audio system can do over-all.To add, if you have equalizer on the output source and/or input audio source, there's a lot of lead-way here to tailor sound optimally , especially in smaller and more challenged audio systems that are typically \"tinny\" in sound quality to begin with. I found using the equalizer function on my iPhone in iTunes clearly helped the quality of sound on a small shelf mini-stereo system I have in which the speakers are  quite small and of marginal quality as well.Feeding the sound through the Amazon Basic Adapter to a larger home stereo certainly allows much fuller and broader range sound quality as well as the means to tailor the sound through your audio system and larger speakers. Just remember, this adapter is analog and 2 channel only.Pairing for this Bluetooth device for my iPhone, iPad and Macs was fast and painless. All Apple devices saw the Amazon adapter immediately and pairing was done in seconds with no need to enter any 3-4 digit codes.As for range, wow, I -was- impressed. With the Bluetooth transmitter (it's very small at less then an inch thick and just under 3X3 inches square with a nice long cable to put it where needed) facing away from my iPhone's location, I was able to go almost two rooms away ((about 25 feet and through two walls) and never lost the connection. In experimenting with the transmitter facing the best direction, my distance increased a little by doing that. I can safely say that you should be able to use this line of sight or with a few obstructions, at a very decent distance apart if needed. Amazon states on its product page, \"up to 30 feet away...\" so I'd say they are reasonably accurate for what I verified as well.The small, low powered A/C adapter outputs at 5V, 150ma. How nice it would be to be able to use a rechargeable battery to power this Bluetooth adapter and have it available to use anywhere.The A/C power plug is a standard small round plug used on many other low powered devices. Considering USB is also 5V, I'm sure there's convertors out there to adapt the power plug to usb to use a usb battery source for portable power. Of course, this now adds more cost for what was originally supposed to be a just under $30 investment.Now having talked about the fact that this adapter is A/C only, I must say that for the just-under $30 price for this Amazon-Basics Bluetooth adapter, one can get competitive  adapters that use a rechargeable power source and spend about the same in the process. If going cordless w/ no A/C power needed is important to you, consider looking at the, GOgroove BlueGate Bluetooth Adapter and the Britelink Bluetooth Audio Receiver with Stereo Output (3.5 mm) for Home and Auto Stereo Systems; both are sold by Amazon. I believe one or both, do come with the mini-stereo cable included since the RCA connector cable included in the Amazon version Bluetooth adapter is typically not used for small devices, only larger (Home theater, sound-bars, etc) audio devices.In summary, I found this Amazon-Basics device well made and it performs decently. For just under $30, it really should come with the other mini stereo cable included and considering it is stingy on power and only consumes 150ma, it would have been far more useful if this device had the option to go cordless for power or came with a power to usb adapter) . Again I say that one can probably find a standard USB charged battery power supply that would power this device, but, then again, there's others out there that can do this and sell for less then this Amazon-Basics device does.I'm giving this an over-all 4 star rating;  5 Stars for performance and function, and 3 stars for the cost factor which includes the need to purchase another cable which for many, will be an absolute requirement if they want to connect it to their audio system (which lacks RCA input connectors).", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Works well, a bit pricey for what's included (and not)", "unixReviewTime": 1400716800, "reviewTime": "05 22, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A26DQMYF5E0GL6", "asin": "B00I59VBH4", "reviewerName": "Don Walton Jr.", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "It's great to stream music from a bluetooth device to your home audio receiver set up.

For the size, it's extremely lightweight and very comfortable to hold. In addition, I personally found it fairly easy to navigate, both internally and externally.This camera boasts about quite a lot of things; large mega-pixel photos, new Bionz-X processor, \"premium\" 50x optical zoom, Wi-Fi/NFC, GPS, viewfinder, tilt-screen, hotshoe and a whole load of different settings to get the most out of your photos. Sounds mouth-watering, doesn't it? But is it really all what it perceives?&#9830; Box Contents & Recommended Extras &#9830;- Box Contents: HX400V Bridge Camera | Battery | USB Cable | AC Adaptor | Power Cable | Shoulder Strap | Instruction Manual.- Recommended Extras:SDHC Memory Card* |Spare Battery.* There's no flash memory(well, enough to take 4 photos), so getting one of these are a must! (You can go for any brand you want, however I would recommend a memory card with no less than 8GB memory capacity & of class 10).&#9830; Ease of Use & Navigation &#9830;I honestly really like the cameras layout, both software and external, I personally found the camera to be very easy to use.In the menu, you have everything set out in their appropriate tabs, so once you've had a good look around, it's pretty easy to remember where everything is located.One much liked aspect about this camera is its 'Fn' (Function) button; this gives you access to 12 settings (11 of which are customisable to your own liking), so changing settings have never been so quick.NFC has always been a feature I adore, this allows you to control the camera with your smartphone using the Playmemories mobile app (though does lack in setting adjustments), plus you can also use this to send over photos over to your phone with one tap (providing your phone supports NFC).There are also a ton of different modes to choose from such as auto, aperture, shutter, manual, scene, sweep panoramic and much more.And if you think that was enough, you can download certain apps from the playmemories camera apps store, some are free and others have a price to pay, normally between 4-8 per app. These range from time lapse, motion shots, bracketing and more.The best way to get these apps onto the camera in my opinion is by connecting the camera directly to you computer via the included cable.That all said, there are a couple of things about the camera I didn't quite get on well with:1) Viewfinder: Not user friendly for people who wear glasses!2) Battery compartment: My tripod has a mid-sized camera plate, where the memory card is stored in the same compartment, I have to take the camera off if I want to gain access to it.So when it comes down to the cameras external and software features, this camera has a lot to be proud of.&#9830; Photo & Video Quality &#9830;If you're not the type of person who likes to dig deep into the photos quality when viewed at its actual size, then I don't think you'd be that disappointed. Most photos taken with this camera look good when viewed on a computer, HDTV, or when posted on social networking sites such as Facebook, but when you really get close to the photo by viewing it at its actual size, you start to see quite a few discrepancies in quality.I found that mainly when shooting in cloudy and lower lighting conditions, you start to lose quality in the photos. They start to lack in sharpness, edges can seem jagged and some posterization can be seen when viewing the photo in its actual size. These issues get increasingly noticeable when more zoom is used, and that's just with optical zoom, not digital.The problem by having advanced photo settings such as \"Aperture Priority\", \"Shutter Priority\" & \"Manual Exposure\" available, is that it will be more enticing for people who want to get the most out of their photos, but those who want to to do just that are more likely to be picky with quality.Video quality on the other hand I found to be rather good, but for goodness sake, if you're planning on using the 50x zoom, do so with a tripod. At the max focal length any slight movement in your positioning will be much noticed in the footage.&#9830; Final Opinion &#9830;&#10004; Pros:&#10003; 1080p video.&#10003; Comfortable to hold with great grip.&#10003; Decent tilt-screen.&#10003; Easy to use & navigate around.&#10003; NFC & Wi-Fi Capability.&#10003; Sweep panoramic mode makes panoramic photos easy to do.&#10003; Variety of modes to choose from.&#10006; Cons:&#10008; Increasing the zoom really degrades image quality.&#10008; Memory card slot could have been better placed.&#10008; Noticeable noise and posterization in photos taken within cloudy and darker scenes.&#10008; Photos not so good when viewed in actual size resolutions (100%).&#10008; Viewfinder isn't so good for people who wear glasses.The camera itself is really nice and I love all the features it has to offer, however I just get the feeling you're paying out more for all these extra features than the photo quality.If the camera ever drops below the $350 mark, then I'd say go for it providing you're not planning to produce large prints or viewing them at their actual size, but for $420... a bit too much for the quality produced.Out of 5, I personally would rate this camera with 3.5/5 stars.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Superb features, however can lack in photo quality", "unixReviewTime": 1400630400, "reviewTime": "05 21, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A2NDI0T1I3EXBC", "asin": "B00I8BIB1S", "reviewerName": "N.

I had upgraded from a Nikon D80 a few years ago and really appreciated the full sensor size and the much better low light on the Canon. I also have a Nikon Coolpix AW100 underwater camera when I need something rugged and really water proof.But taking a 4 pound camera on backpack adventures was too much, so I have been looking for a light weight camera that could give me as close to the same capabilities as the Canon 5D - a high standard.I have purchased and used a dozen or so of the point-and-shoot cameras. Canon Elf, Powershot, Nikon, Lumix, etc. They are not good enough for any of my serious photos - due to both the lack of viewfinder in bright scenes, the crappy controls for exposure/aperture/ISO shooting, and the compression artifacts on the captured scene. The Nikon Coolpix AW100 doesn't take great photos, but better than an iPhone. They just don't do raw. And you need real glass to take good pictures. I will continue to bring my waterproof Nikon camera with me for those really wet experiences, but I wanted something more than a point and shoot and less than a 4 pound professional camera.I wanted a camera that gave me a viewfinder - outside the LCD screens of all cameras just doesn't work (additionally I need glasses to see up close and it was not easy taking outdoor shots and needing to put on my glasses to see the silly screen - or not see the screen in bright sunlight). I wanted light weight, RAW capture, full manual control in addition to shutter priority/aperture priority. I wanted one that could do decent video and focus during the shot while zooming.I wanted one that I could recharge via USB (I bring solar power with me for iPad GPS use - I have power to spare).I wasn't sure if interchangeable lenses was important. A good built in would have been OK. Flash? Well OK if it was there - most built in are marginal at best, but in the back country it might be the only thing I had.So I settled on the Sony A6000. I went ahead and got two lenses - the starter lenses (16-50mm and a 55-210mm). I also got an extra Sony brand battery (more on this later).Canon 5D: 3.75 pounds (70-300mm lens, one extra battery)Sony A6000: 1.7 pounds (55-210mm lens, one extra battery) - but I will probably bring both lenses which brings it to 2.0 pounds and I will also have 16-50mm lens.So a 2 pound saving in weight - an expensive 2 pounds, but you also get the flash, a wifi remote control to an iPad, real video, and with an app the ability to do time lapse capture. And it is smaller. Much smaller.While I continue to think that the pictures from the 5D are better (especially in low light), the A6000 gives it a run for the money. The 5D can do spectacular video, but the 5D doesn't do autofocus while capturing and I can's see the back panel in daylight making the 5D almost useless for amateur event capturing. A6000 wins hands down for video for me - I focus on still images with an occasional video thrown in.I was concerned about not having through the lens SLR viewing, but honestly I like the A6000 just as much. The on-screen viewing and information is all I need to know the framing, the expressions,  if I have focus and how the exposure is going to turn out. The resultant pictures are always much better than what I see through the viewfinder. This is a big win for me. (I do wish there was an easy control to turn the big screen on/off - I want to conserve power so I use viewfinder only, but there are times I want to see the screen - the menu seems to be the only way to get there. Minor bitch. If Sony cares they could fix it in software.)The A6000 has a reasonable number placement and number of on-camera controls. Menu keys and quick access seems OK - not perfect, but nothing is. I don't use it in auto mode - strictly A, S or M mode and they work just fine. I didn't buy it to be a point and shoot. Pictures have been stunning so far. I will know more after my extended hike, but so far I'm pleased. WAY better than any other point and shoot I have owned.So there are some short term problems - I am an Apple Mac user so the software from Sony does not work on the latest operating system so I need to remove the SD card. So what -- it's what I do most of the time with all my cameras. Apple has not released the software to read A6000 raw images so I only use the fine compression JPEG. Actually better than I expected, I will go to raw when the Mac software is upgraded.The A6000 does seem to really drain batteries. My 5D lasts a good week on a single charged battery and I don't think A6000 will make it through a full day - but again I will know more after my extended trip. I purchased some spare cheap batteries, but the A6000 rejected them with a menu screen saying they were incompatible. I paid three times more for the Sony official battery - it worked. I also got an external charger - a good purchase.The A6000 has built in WiFi (no GPS) for communication to iPad/iPhones (and probably other devices). It's cool to control and see what the camera sees and move pictures to a better display. Of course you can also take pictures with the iPad. Could just be a toy, but I like it. It is not that easy to set it up - but OK. It's an ease of use thing...I am not impressed with the placement of the SD card in the battery case. It is right against the door so my fat fingers have trouble grabbing the card. I fixed it by putting a tag on the card so I can pull/hold it. That fixed it. Just a design flaw with an easy fix.I have noted that the sensor seems to attract dirt. I have needed to clear the sensor more than once. (I could see the dust footprint in images.) I don't know if the static properties of the sensor are not resistant to dust or the placement of the sensor or I'm just a dirty person. I have not had this problem with the 5D. I'm going to the dusty grand canyon next week and it will be a real test.I'm pleased with the two lenses. I might get another prime lens, but I'm a bit worried about the dirt aspects. I am pleased the A6000 has interchangeable lenses. I do wish the A6000 was a bit more weather resistant, but I would trade light weight for the weather aspects. I would like to get rid of the back display - the viewfinder works just fine for me. I turn the back display off anyway to save batteries - and put it in airplane mode.I have not tested the flash.I really like the time lapse application that you can buy from the Sony App store. That looks like fun. I wish it could do 2fps capture, it seems to be minimum of 3 seconds per capture. It claims 1/second, but that didn't work for me. I probably have some setting wrong.Sony uses strange language on their menu items. Probably all camera manufactures use non-standard language - so I will need to buy some book to explain what they mean. The users guide is useless IMHO. (i.e. DRO/Auto HDR -- Compensates automatically for brightness and contrast. - so what does THAT mean?)All in all I'm very pleased with the A6000. I will continue to bring my 5D and my Nikon Coolpix AW100 underwater camera when I don't need to go super light weight, but the A6000 can capture great images.If I learn more after a few hiking adventures I'll share that in the future.========Update: I took the A6000 on a 10 day Grand Canyon adventure - three days off the grid with no power-up. It's not a fair test since I had both the A6000 and a 5D. I primarily used the A6000 for video and time lapse capture. The 5D became my primary camera for still pictures - I really like that camera.  [I will update this again after a 7 night off the grid hike in July with ONLY the A6000.]Battery Life: What I learned is that the A6000 in time lapse mode is power hungry. It will record about 2 to 3 hours of time-lapse and the battery will be drained. Good news is a 10W solar panel brings it back to life in a short time - few hours. I never ran out of juice with this combo while taking MANY time-lapse sequences. Your battery mileage may vary, this is NOT the reason I got the A6000 - I got it for still photos in the back country. I will really test that on the next hike.Dirt: I was pleased that with all the dust encountered I did not have a serious problem with sensor dust. After coming back I did a quick test and found a few dust areas, but within acceptable range. I will bring either a small can of air or a air duster with me to clean the sensor after a few lens changes. There is a sensor cleaning mode - hard to find in the menus - but I can't tell if that or the air duster is cleaning the sensor. I think it is a problem for Sony to address in the future.Ruggedness: This is not a really rugged camera. The camera was mounted on a tripod and a wind gust slammed the camera into the ground - an area with small rocks. The lens hit first and was damaged beyond repair. Just a slight bending of the adjustment rings and it was history - no glass damage. The little motors that move the lens in/out just can't overcome the -now- oval (not round) rings. I now have a nice paper weight for home (PS I registered the camera with my homeowners policy after purchase and was given a full replacement - no deductible. Thank you State Farm.) The body was not hurt. Bottom line, these are more delicate lenses than you find on a good professional SLR. I suspect the same for water / moisture - not that rugged.Viewfinder: The viewfinder is very acceptable. No where near as good as an SLR, but still acceptable. Framing and focus works great (my biggest concern) and the exposure information is better than an SLR (Sony calls it a zebra display). It is hard to see very dark regions of the scene and it does blow out the highlights - not like looking through glass. I would like image review to be on the screen and not in the viewfinder. It looks like I'm going to turn off image review in order to keep the viewfinder live between shots - I will miss this confirmation review - but turning off the viewfinder for 2 seconds after each shot means I might miss the next shot.Manual Controls: Hey, it works! I can quickly get to all the needed settings - ISO, Aperture, Shutter speed, exposure, manual/shutter priority/aperture priority, etc. in a quick and simple way. Yes, it takes some use to learn where they are, but it works. This was one of my big concerns - I wanted a real camera that can take the difficult and challenging exposure shots. The A6000 meets my needs!Image quality: This is the reason I got the camera. The sensor is not as good as the 5D by a long shot. At ISO6400 there is noticeable grain. Not unacceptable, but not the clean low light performance of a full frame camera (that costs 4X). I also notice color fringing - well the lenses are not prime. [Note to self - get a prime lens.] I'm shooting RAW again (Apple updated the software) so I'm pretty pleased with the image quality. I don't hesitate bringing the A6000 when I want to get good pictures - especially given the light weight/size of the camera.Bottom line: I'm still pleased. It is head and shoulders above any other point-and-shoot I have used. It does what I want for exposure control. It's not as good as a full-frame sensor SLR, but fits a great spot in my image capture tool lineup.Someone asked an interesting question \"Is this a good starter camera?\" I think the answer is yes, but only if you are planning to learn about photography and plan on spending significant time to grow into the camera and what it takes to capture complex images.More to come after 7 days of backpacking end of July...", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Sony A6000 - A backpacking camera", "unixReviewTime": 1399161600, "reviewTime": "05 4, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "AGATRDOFW48DK", "asin": "B00I8BICB2", "reviewerName": "D.

I sold all my Nikon gear (D7000, etc.) and then sold the NEX-5R and replaced it with a NEX-6.  I later bought a used NEX-7.  Recently I bought the A6000 to replace one or the other of the NEX cameras.The A6000 is improved in almost every way over the NEX-6.  I love the feel of the NEX-7, but the A6000 is probably a better camera.  The A6000 has taken a lot of ideas from the A7 and A7R and applied them to this camera.  This means that you can customize the button/knob/icon settings to suit your needs.  I recommend ebooks by Gary Friedman to sort out this information and make it the camera personalized to meet your needs.The upgrade from 16 to 24 MP is appreciated, especially when cropping the shots.Vibration reduction, or optical steady shot (OSS) is built into the lens.  With my Tamron 18-200, it works exceptionally well.This camera has vastly improved its ability to focus quickly.  I turned off AF Prefocus because of this.Because it will shoot 11 shots per minute, I recommend a 90 MB/sec or faster memory card.  It will shot at least twice as many shots than the NEX-6 before slowing down.  In JPEG mode, I was able to shoot 50 shots in about 4.5 seconds before it slowed down.  The faster memory card means that photos go from the buffer onto the memory card faster.  With this camera, you don't have to wait until the buffer is empty before taking the next photo.The quality of the photo seems to be limited only by the quality of the lens.

I was looking for a compact system for international travel and after reading several reviews on different mirrorless cameras decided to purchase this A6000 with kit lens.It's been 5 days since I received and tried it out, have not shot more than 300 images in total, and battery fully depleted twice. After the first full charge, I got only 140 shots, I thought it could be because of going through menus and few other things like zoom, EVF, image review and so on. But after the second full charge, I turned off pre-AF, image review, reduced standby to 10 secs, set it to airplane mode used more of LCD rather than EVF, reduced the use of zoom.. it still did not help get much out of the battery. So, got around 150 images and 5 clips of video (6 mins in total) in around combined two hours of use. I noticed that the charge dropped by a percent every time I took a shot with flash on. This is very disappointing. The battery takes 4-5 hours of charging time and does not last even half that time of usage. I can buy additional batteries but concern is charging them at the same time. Not all places have multiple wall outlets where you could charge them at the same time. It does not make sense to disable some of features to save the battery life.I had my D7K for three years now and have been on vacations multiple times without extra battery pack. After shooting 300+ still and videos, image review, playback etc., at the end of the day there is still enough juice left in the battery. I know I cannot directly compare it with bigger battery, yet the numbers I see are nowhere close to the specs. I could have got a bad sample, don't know.Another big mistake was buying the kit lens, the images come out dull. I took few images and compared it with the images from my old P&S; (Sony DSC-W50) and with D7K+18-200mm, images from a6000 are too soft, just don't stand out. I have taken great images with my D7K and P&S; cameras, but have not succeeded yet on shooting one such with this camera.If you are planning on buying this camera, I suggest skip the kit lens and go with the 35mm f1.8 if you can afford it. I looked at buying this lens but it is too expensive. It is not that I cannot afford it, just can't justify the cost ($400 / $450) when I paid only couple hundred for the equivalent Nikon lens.The flash and selector wheel / enter button feels & sounds cheap plastic. If you use the power zoom during video, the screeching zoom noise is clearly audible. There are few minor annoyances, I can live with it.Rest of the camera is great, I really want to keep the camera. The low life of the battery is bothering me and the kit lens did not do any favor. I feel something is wrong with it, so planning on returning it.

Of course, when the \"upgrade\" came out, I had to have it (after I did my research, of course!). So, now I have both (and intend to keep both, as I always like to have a 'back-up' camera handy).For those of you looking for a review on image quality and other points of usability, well, I can tell you that there are dozens (or more) excellent reviews out there that already cover that (generally they give pretty high marks for IQ, DR, etc). I read and viewed many of them before making the decision to buy and here are a few things that those reviews omitted:THE GRIP:- the grip on the a6000 is not as nice (for me) as the NEX-6. Like a good woman, the NEX-6 was \"curvy\" in all the right places, offering superb grip when dancing or running around (as I often do, camera-in-hand; yes, I always use a wrist strap, just in case). The a6000, despite what I've seen in my research, seems to have a shallower grip (due to a thicker body/mid-section). If you have even moderately long nails, you will find the need to trim them so that you can get the same grip you may be used to on the NEX6.- the bottom (where the hands' \"moon\" spot, in palmistry, sits) seems a bit \"edgier/sharper\" and doesn't nestle into that part of the hand as easily.- the rear thumbgrip on the a6000 is more vertical than the more organic \"diagonal\" of the NEX6. Ergo, the thumb has to be in a tighter, more upright angle to the rest of the hand, in order to have a more fully supported shot. I prefer the more \"C\" shaped gripping style of the NEX6, again.- the top rear edge of the a6000 is at a 90-degree angle, with two levels. On the NEX-6, this is a smooth, beveled edge (more like a 45-degree angle). Sometimes, I have to put my thumb in non-optimal places on the camera, to get just the right angle. On the NEX-6, there were quite a few places where this was comfortable. On the a6000, there's really only one (the default) and it's still not as comfortable as the NEX6. :(BUTTONRY/DO-HICKEYS:- my main pet peeve in this category is the On-Off switch. I didn't like it on the NEX6 and what's worse, they switched the order of On and Off on the a6000, but used the same \"push/pull in the opposite direction as what you read on the dial\" format! Maybe my brain is odd, but if On is left and Off is written to the right of that, my brain would be happiest with a switch that MOVED left for On and right for off (or vice-versa, as long as it's logical.) The good news is that the text is now white on black, versus white on champagne/silver on the NEX6, so it's a little easier to read.- I also really liked the smoothness and shininess of the NEX6 power switch/shutter release. It left no indent on my finger during extended shooting sessions and, gave me a soft spot for my index finger to make contact when not \"pressing\" buttons. And, when letting someone else take your photo, like when at a party or when travelling, it's easier for new/temporary users to see the shiny, champagne-colored button than the black, matchy-matchy button. Especially when you have to answer questions like \"what do I push?\" and it can be confused with other 'black buttons' in that area. Also, the a6000 power/shutter button flat surface is smaller and there's a \"groove\" around it which I fear will collect grime, over time (despite my very particular care-taking of my 'stuff')- speaking of smooth and shiny colors, the MI (multi-interface) shoe and lens mount were both finished in a 'dull' silver on my otherwise black NEX-6. These are both black on my black a6000. The teeny ridges on the lens mount are also less pronounced on the a6000. I generally don't see it, though, as my elastic strap lens cap keeper sits there and covers some of it. I kinda liked having the silver accents, though, as some of my lenses are silver and it integrates them a bit better.- the MI shoe on the NEX-6 came with a protective insert, which I thought was a very smart idea (protection & better-looking). In fact, I put them on all my \"shoe'ed\" cameras. The a6000 does NOT come with this. The NEX-6 one works in either camera. If you don't have one, I recommend it, as there are some sensitive contacts in that MI shoe. Options can be found for a few dollars on ebay (surely, they'd be cheap enough - especially in bulk - for Sony to include one with a ~$700 camera, but who knows...?) {NOTE: if this point is important to you, please see my 6/9 comment to this review for links and clarification.}- the screen - ok, Sony, you only give us image capture ratios of 3:2 or 16:9 to choose from and the screen is 16:9 (altho, it'd be great to have the otherwise fairly standard 4:3 and 1:1, as well, just for fun). I get it, there's the black bars alongside the photo for settings icons (in that one display mode). Whatever. But, why do you not center the display part of the screen in the non-display part of the screen?? And, why move it to the opposite side in the a6000? Oh, so you have to make (and we have to buy) new screen protectors (if we're loyal enough to buy them from you in the first place, that is). Um, ok. I happen to have an extra one here and it looks like I'll be putting it on upside-down, to save the $10-15 from buying a new one (if I could even find one in stock, at this point, anywhere). {UPDATE: yep, I put it on, upside-down, and sharpie'd the logo so it wouldn't drive me nuts - it isn't super-pretty, but satisfies me good enough. Doesn't work great in 'portrait' when wearing polarized sunglasses. This is pretty typical, and the result is just barely passable, so just fyi.}. SONY: please center it next time. It's nice to have a centered point-of-reference when composing via the LCD screen.CONNECTIVITY:- I currently have no use for NFC (still using my trusty old E72 nokia {RIP Symbian s60} & an ipod that won't upgrade to iOS7). I know that NFC isn't 'activated' until another NFC-enabled device 'bumps' it, but I'd like to turn it off completely. I've searched the in-camera menu and the manual and have not found a way to \"deactivate\" it. Selecting NFC in the the menu just keeps returning me back to the menu page, to select it again. I'd rather not have it using battery power (however minimal) while it's waiting to be bumped with another NFC device (nor, do I want yet more \"waves\" pulsating through my hand as I carry my camera all day.) If it serves a purpose in my life, I'm fine with that, but this currently does not.- they've swapped the HDMI port/jack from a mini (NEX-6), to a mirco (a6000). Just fyi, in case you need to buy a new cable (like I do). This may confuse some users, as the ports now look very similar. USB still at the top, near the Charge light. And, I'm one of the people who love the in-camera USB charging. (I also bought an external wall/car charger, as I always carry a second battery - LOVE that I can charge two batteries at the same time OR, carry a 'stick charge box' thingie in my bag and recharge it during down time at an event, regardless of access to an outlet. So cool, sony!)- the Wi-Fi has the WPS option, but I could not get it to work (I have, on other devices, tho; yet, I do have a somewhat old router, c.2011). YMMV. Entering the SSID & PWD isn't a huge problem, and you only need to do it once. Navigating the 'keyboard' isn't super-easy, but it works. Same as the NEX-6. It does ask two questions that aren't addressed in the manual (or via the internet, as far as I've found): IP setting and Priority.MENU:- yes, the menu on the a6000 is much improved! It's not perfect, but it's got a better (or, existent!) hierarchy, so if you want, you can remember X > Y > Z > 1,2,3... vs. X > scroll, scroll, scroll, loop, scroll, scroll, scroll back > Z > 1,2,3... of course, smart planning of your several customizable buttons, as mentioned in other reviews, can significantly reduce 'searching', as well.- if you liked the old \"tiled\" style - you can turn that option on (and it's better-looking now). But, once you choose one of 6 main categories, you're right back into the default a6000 menu. I do kinda like this option (it's pretty); however, with the other option, it seems to remember what setting you were on and returns to it, after you leave the menu. I did not see an option to customize this behavior, as I've seen in other cameras. I'm ok with it returning to last point, as navigating the tabs in order to change other settings is fairly easy.- the 'descriptions' of the mode-dial modes all now have a background image, depicting an example of what each might be used for (waterfalls for shutter priority, fireworks for manual, etc). This makes it a bit easier to remember, and maybe even use, for beginning enthusiasts, but can also make the text a bit harder to read.- the SCN modes are all the same, but the animated on-screen 'dial' is on the left now, (rather than on the right, as with the NEX-6). There are also navigation choices on the bottom, which the NEX-6 didn't have (self-explanatory, but still helpful to have). In addition, the selection of SCN modes rolls in the opposite direction as what you may be used to on the NEX6 ('right' now goes down the list, instead of selecting up the list). I somewhat prefer the new way, as, for the first 5 modes, the highlight is what moves and not the menu choices, (which got dizzying after a while on the NEX-6). They will eventually scroll on the a6000 as well, however, as you move further down/up the list. They are also in a slightly different order, now. And, while the font size is larger, it seems still hard to read. The background images are mostly the same, but have been \"punched up\" and cropped a bit. My old panasonic was great in this aspect, as it showed a chart of icons that could be quickly navigated via up/down/left/right. If I needed more info/description on a less-used mode, there was a button for that. Otherwise, I had a handy, easy chart that allowed me to find what I needed quickly (icons always in the same place), and i could discover new ones, along the way. Sony needs an update here, as there are many fewer icons and much more confusion. I'd welcome a fix to this in a Firmware update (with the option to keep it the old way, for those who've gotten used to it).So, despite the nits I've picked above, I plan to keep this camera as the \"important\" specs far outweigh these little issues listed. If they'd kept some of the ergonomics from the NEX-6 (not all, but some) and thought out a few things a little better, it'd be a 5-star camera. But, if it takes excellent pics and checks all your boxes, then maybe it WILL be a 5-star camera for you!I rely on reviews to help me make buying decisions.

Some people may be wondering if it's worth buying this, or the discounted NEX-6. In short, it's worth the upgrade for the following reasons:PROS/REASONS TO BUY OVER THE NEX-6:1. It has a better OLED viewfinder (yes the NEX-6 had a higher resolution viewfinder, but the difference is not noticeable, and the colours are better in the new viewfinder... So overall it's better in the A6000)2. It has a much better menu layout and quick access to change settings via the fn button. With one click, you can access options like white balance, af points, ISO, etc.... If nothing else, the menu update is worth the upgrade.3. It's 24 megapixel sensor allows higher detailed images. Some might ask, but doesn't this increase the noise? The short answer: No. The noise control is better than the NEX-6.4. The Bionz X processor is better and faster. It is just overall faster, and leads to quicker processing and faster overall performance, especially when it comes to the autofocus system.5. The AF is fast! And I mean FAST!!!!!CONS:1. The A6000 has a serious flaw as did it's predecessor (the nex-6). I'm sure Sony knows about this problem, but didn't do anything to fix it. And that is the fact that it does not allow you to use the bracketing feature in conjunction with the self-timer. It's either one or the other. For example, if you set up you camera on a tripod, and want to take a 3 image bracketed sequence (say for an HDR image), then you cannot set the timer to fire off 3 consecutive shots in bracketing mode. Yes you can fire off 3 regular shots with the self-timer, but not 3 bracketed shots. You have to press the shutter button three times manually. This in turn can introduce camera shake. The bracketing function and self-timer are in the same menu, so it's either one or the other. Sony really needs to fix this about the camera and it's a serious flaw.....2. The A6000 also does not have an in-built microphone input, nor does it have a headphone line out for monitoring audio. If this camera is meant to replace the NEX 7 and NEX 6, then it SHOULD have it! A serious blunder on Sony's part.Overall, the Sony A6000 is a fantastic camera, and could have been perfect. It is worth buying over the NEX-6 without a doubt. Even if the NEX 6 drops to below $400 with the 16-50 lens, I would still recommend purchasing the A6000 over it. I'm a pro photographer, and I would highly recommend this camera for those who want something light to take travelling, but don't want to compromise on image quality.

(see example video [ vimeo.com/93195590 ])- Despite other reviews, button and control layout is reasonable.- Good ISO range with auto-ISO having bounds (e.g. you can say max iso is 3600)- 11fps burst mode with auto-focus between shots is cool.Cons:- Eyepiece activation is too sensitive.Lots of things trick it into thinking you are using the eyepiece... which turns off the LCD for a second. Very annoying.- Shutter is louder than you'd expect for a mirrorless.- Battery hungry.Toggling airplane mode helps, but no way to create a custom button action to do this.- Wish there was better control over focus in videos (e.g. when in video mode, half press would cause refocus).Warnings:- Sony is clearly trying to create a \"marketplace\" for camera apps. Expect to spend another $30+ to get features after you buy the camera. Most other cameras come with things like remote triggers, timelapse, multi-frame noise reductions, etc. The A6000 (and probably future Sony cameras) do not. Sony expects you to pay extra for them.- Sony has a public API to develop your own apps, but it is extremely limited for this camera.

After putting the stand assembly(which swivels)  on the TV unit and plugging in, they start a step process to get everything running. And one of the things that came up early was getting the remote working to control my receiver from Direct TV. I wasted a lot of time because the instructions just keep telling you to give it another try in order to get a response from the receiver. So I exited from that and proceeded to get the TV online where it was a 'dumb' TV basically. Then I tried with the apps for Netflix, Amazon and Mgo, which are the places where I might rent movies. All did good after I went through the sign-in. I stopped for that day, and resumed early the next day. As I powered up the TV, I received a message from Samsung that an update had been sent, and also from my DirectTV provider. I also noticed my cable box wouldn't transmit a 1080p resolution because I was using the component jacks instead. So after re-connecting to HDMI1, my picture came in like never before! And then re-tried the remote control on my DirectTV receiver, and now it worked just fine! I should comment about the sound, because my old HDTV had the problem where when I played a HD dvd, the output volume was so low I had to buy an amplifier and speaker set for a boost on the sound level. Well, the quality of the sound from this unit is very good, but the same problem exists for a dvd playback. So, a sound bar is probably in my future. There was a couple other features mentioned on the Amazon site for this series model about voice commands and hand signal recognition. I didn't need them, but it is not on this model anyway.(need to go to 6400 series) Overall, I have to say the picture quality is terrific and , for now, makes me happy with my purchase.--Update 4/22/14-After a week or so, the only problem I encountered is the \"anynet+\" feature which is supposed to let me control any other Samsung device with one remote. I do have a Samsung BluRay player, and it did control it as claimed.

Upgrading from a Canon 7D and using it in conjunction with a Pany AF100.  Will be testing this baby over next couple of days, but I am waiting for an upgraded SD card for some compressed 4k shooting. :-)  Probably the most excited I've been about a camera since the AF100.  I do mostly video work, but shoot a  lotta stills.  Will do some comparisons between the Canon 7D and G4.  4 stars are just for being here ahead of schedule.Update:First impressions out of the box, coming from the viewpoint of an old Canon 7d user:I am comparing a Canon 7D with a EFS 17-55mm lens and the G4 with a Pany 14-140mm.The obvious:  The G4 is about half the size and much lighter but it still feels solid in the hands.  Crop factor is 2X (goes up to 2.3 in some 4k movie modes).  Interface is a nice step up from the 7D, although I'm having to get use to not accidentally touching the LED touch screen and going into some menu mode.  Oddly enough, the Canon zoom above is about twice the size of the Panasonic, but when comparing a Panasonic 100mm-300mm to a Canon 55mm-250mm, the Panasonic is about the same size but weighs more than the Canon.  You do get some usable reach with the increased crop factor which makes my Panasonic 100mm-300mm equivalent to a 200mm to 600mm telephoto.The articulating LED is definitely a nice feature compared to the 7D's fixed backplate one.  When opening the LED up on the G4, it feels a bit flimsy.  It seems to actually push up on the LVF rubber eyepiece.  I wonder how much use it will take before becoming a problem?The back video record button (used when not in \"movie\" mode) is not as easy to turn on/off when you have big thumbs.  It's nice that it crops the LVF frame when you are recording so it's real easy to tell if it is recording video or not.  There is a slight lag when turning video recording off so it's easy to hit the button twice because you thought you didn't stop recording at first.  The \"movie\" mode is nice in that it gives you the proper framing from the get-go in the LVF, and now the shutter button starts and stops video recording.  One thing I do NOT like about this is that apparently you lose the ability to shoot stills when shooting video.  And that goes for shooting video while in the \"still\" modes.  So in order to shoot stills in the middle of a video shoot, you have to end video recording and then shoot the still.  If you are in \"movie\" mode, you have to change modes.  I might be missing something as I seem to recall that you can shoot video and shoot stills at the same time with the G4.  I guess that's what the manual is all about. :-)Silent shooting mode is truly silent...7D has a quiet mode, but the mirror is still moving so you hear it pretty loudly.The LVF is a pleasure to use.  Nice and bright and unlike the 7d, you can use it for playback as well as menu selections.One thing that drove me crazy with the mirrored cameras is that when in live view mode using the LED, shooting a high speed set of stills basically disabled your LED.  I use an attached Zacuto EVF on the Canon LED and would shoot sporting events through it for video purposes, but every now and then I'd like to shoot a bunch of high speed photographs and this would often blow it for me as I would have to either take the Zacuto off and then look through the viewfinder or spray and pray using the blacked out LED.Looking forward to using the internal time-lapse feature.  The remote timer is another piece of gear I no longer need in my bag.I have had one problem so far. Some odd LED screen-to-black blips has been happening as I move the camera around.  The LVF does not do this, but there have been at least a dozen times when twisting the LED and rotating the camera body, the LED screen goes \"off\".  I'm at the point where I can pretty much replicate it.  I'm in manual mode (although I don't think that matters) and I will slowly raise the camera to about 45 degrees towards the ceiling with the LED maybe twisted at about 15 degrees.  The screen goes off and then goes back on about 1 second later as I continue in my arc.  Will test it further and take a video of my action.  Not a deal breaker, but it makes me concerned that there's something not right with this particular camera.  (I almost think it's the LED thinking I'm reversing it around to 180 facing because it only seems to do it when I'm raising the camera up slowly and putting a slight twist on the LED).Anyway, besides that one concern, I am looking forward to doing some comparison shooting, both video/stills with the two cameras.

And something i've been waiting for for a long time: a gamma curve to control shadows/highlights! It may not be as expansive as prosumer/pro video camera controls, but it's a very nice thing to have. The ax100 has basically nothing, just a cinematone on or off.10bit 4:2:2 outputFinally!!!! 8bit is remarkable for what it can do, but many have felt 10bit wide adoption has been overdue. It's tons more information and gives you far more to work with to grade your image. The cheapest recorder that can handle it at the moment is the $2000 atomos shogun, but hopefully we'll see some other options soon. Now if only they chose anything other than that hdmi micro connection....Lens choiceIs huge, you can adapt tons to this camera, including the speedbooster which as the name suggests, gives you a faster F stop when using larger format lenses. I'm also eager to try slapping on an old b4 zoom lens which i've tried with the c100 with mixed but encouraging results, and the smaller sensor of the m43 should be a big step towards usable with that.

Both of our cars (1 and 2 year old) have built-in navigation, one of them with a touch screen, and our phones have turn by turn navigation too, yet TomTom provides a better experience with excellent information display, a fluid touch response, smooth graphics, and a familiar interface.I can already say, if you have an aging TomTom GPS, and are looking to upgrade, this is definitely a good time. If you are coming from other brands, you won't regret switching. If your car's built-in navigation is no longer up to date, you are probably used to older technology, and this GPS will blow your mind.Long story:Our last two GPS devices were TomTom (Go 720 from 2007, and XXL550TM from 2010). We tried other brands, but we always returned back to TomTom. I am very picky when it comes to the look and feel of the interface for things like GPS devices and video streaming devices, which do just one thing, and they have no excuse for not getting it right. TomTom had it right on the devices we owned before, I liked the way that icons are big, shortcuts are where they need to be, and things that you may want to see, are either already there or are very handy. I am glad to see that they are sticking with what they got right.The highlights of Go 500 for me are:0) Natural way of entering addresses. After so many years of using GPS devices, I didn't realize how stupid it was to enter an address in the order of state, city, street, number till I used the new Go 500. What a relief! It saves tons of time too, because the device takes care of figuring out how to map the address to its parts.1) The capacitive touch screen (like in your smart phones) is far easier to use that the pressure touch screens.2) I don't know if this is a real thing, but I feel like my mind is more comfortable looking at the smooth animation of the map, compared to the inch-by-inch jumpy scroll of other navigation devices I own. Perhaps the anticipation of how the map will refresh at every second unconsciously keeps the mind busy, or maybe it is just an aesthetic improvement, but you will not want to go back to anything that doesn't have smooth graphics, including the built-in navigation of some high-end cars.3) Distance to gas stations on the right vertical column. This is the best display of POI information I've seen. It gives you how far you are from a gas station at a glance, without needing to interact with voice or touch. When you are panicked, getting lost in the POI search menu is the last thing you'd want to do.4) The way the device attaches to the cradle is super easy, finally. I got used to the old way of turning a large flat screw on the back of the device. It worked when you got it right, but was an ergonomic torture. Now, there is a docking plug (like ipods used to be) and a catcher dent in the back, which together hold the device in place. Installing the GPS is as easy as putting your ipod on a dock.5) It is super fast.Cons:1) The round shape of the TomTom is their signature, but if the bottom and back could be flat, it would be much easier to use as a replacement for built-in navigation of my car. There is already a huge display on which I can temporarily place the gps.2) Voice commands are nice for simple things, like &#34;go home&#34;, but you cannot just say the address.3) You need to scroll through the icons for navigating the main functions. The screen is big enough to have three rows of icons, it is needless to have to scroll through the main function icons. When driving, if I don't see a function, it is as good as it is not there.I will update this review as I get to use it more. I am especially curious about how well the traffic function works, as it seems like traffic is at the center stage in this model.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent information display, a fluid touch response, smooth graphics, and a familiar interface.", "unixReviewTime": 1398729600, "reviewTime": "04 29, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A1ACCPBSLWOL3E", "asin": "B00IA9LMNW", "reviewerName": "Levi", "helpful": [11, 11], "reviewText": "I've looked around between the Nikon P330, Coolpix A, Sony NEX-5T, NEX-6, and A6000. Basically, I personally found the P340 to be the best value. I bought the P330 two weeks ago and thought that I could save $$ by just buying the P330 & the wifi adapter (WU-1a). I was wrong. The P330 was ok but having a wifi dongle was somewhat of an inconvenience because it's an extra accessory that you have to hang on to and bring everywhere, not to mention trying not to lose it since it's so small.I had to return the P330 but was stuck between the Coolpix A (imported) and the NEX-5T, which both are around the same price. I like the Coolpix A but aside from the fix(prime lens), you would also need to buy a wifi adapter. Downers.The NEX-5T was good, but the EVF and dial modes on the NEX-6 was a no brainer. BUT, I found out that the A6000 will be coming out soon, and will have everything the NEX-6 has plus few added features like higher resolution, more focus points, etc. But at the same time, it is about $800. More than what I originally wanted to spend. I mean for just a couple more hundreds i could get a D7100 DSLR.So I decided that I would opt to just exchange the P330 for the P340. And so far I'm really glad with the decision. Main difference between the two are the built-in WiFi (aside from transferring images, you can also control and take photos using a compatible phone- I use an iphone 5 and didn't have problems connecting, transferring and taking pics using my phone. Another is the control ring, where you can assign it's function from zoom to focus to aperture. And I really like that feature. It adds manual control of the camera.I kinda don't like that when you use it for focusing the image on the display zooms in to the area of focus and then zooms out when you're about to press the shutter, but I can live with that. I also noticed better/faster focusing on the P340 than the P330, as well as better image quality overall than the P330.This is my first impression so far, with just a few hours of play with the P340. I like the build quality, the user-friendly controls, the color, the simplicity. Cons for the P340 are the relatively slow writing of images, slow menu navigation/processing of changes, double confirmation prior to deleting images (which may be a good thing but I wish I could turn the double confirmation on/off), manual focus with the control ring or the in-camera controls, and relatively low battery life.Overall, I would still recommend the P340 for those looking for an affordable, quality-built compact camera with built-in wifi, RAW and full manual control,", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great little on-the-go camera.", "unixReviewTime": 1395100800, "reviewTime": "03 18, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A2ORX87EL9I2R7", "asin": "B00IA9LMNW", "reviewerName": "M. moore \"M. moore\"", "helpful": [5, 22], "reviewText": "A great review on the P340.

There were a few things that concerned me before I bought it, but I didn't see any one of them being a show-stopper. Using the Nikon P600 made me rethink my concerns and I discovered a couple other issues that were show-stoppers, at least for me.Concerns before I purchased it:No way to add any accessories to this device, not even a lens filter for protection and no lens hood option.No RAW format.Concerns after I purchased the Nikon P600:No lens filter available at all:The first day I took the camera out for some shooting, it started drizzling. It made me realize just how many times I clean my old camera's lens filter every day I use it. A lot! Dust, rain, whatever, I am always striving to keep it clean. I thought about the fact that I have no way to protect the lens of the Nikon (except a lens cap, of course) and every time I cleaned it I introduced the chance of a scratch or worse.No lens hood available at all:It didn't take too many shots with the Nikon P600 before I realized that I was seeing some of the same kind of wash-out in some shots that my wife gets with her Canon SX30 with the same kind of sunny sky shots. I take the same shots with my Panasonic FZ-100 (with a lens hood) and I get no wash-out at all.No RAW format:I didn't know if I would miss RAW or not, although for the past year I have been shooting nothing but RAW with my Panasonic FZ-100. But I realized right away that I did miss it. Knowing that with the jpegs, any editing I do causes some loss of data started to bug me some. Why Nikon doesn't do RAW is beyond me!Showstoppers:1. The LCD display on the Nikon P600 works beautifully indoors or in the shade, but try looking at a shot in full or very bright sunlight and the screen washes out so bad there were times I couldn't tell if my shot was in focus or not! That got irritating very fast!2. The zoom. Yes, I know, the zoom - the very thing that makes this camera so attractive also was, for me at least, a major issue. When it works it is amazing, really. You can take a photo of an object that is so far away! Unfortunately, the zoom would shift into and out of focus all the time! Not just at the distance shots either. Most often I would be forced to press the shutter half-way to get it to focus at all. I know this action is supposed to &#34;lock in&#34; the focus, but neither my wife's Canon nor my Panasonic make you do this to get any focus at all. And what was really irritating was that this happened with video all the time, too! It made video shooting a pain.So, when I added up all of the issues above, I came to the conclusion this camera was not for me, so I returned it today. I'm going to now wait for the Canon SX60 to come out.

I suspect that Nikon wanted to compete with the Olympus TG-2 with this model, which has similar features. The biggest upgrade here is the 24 mm wide-angle lens and faster maximum aperture of 2.8. The Olympus still has an F2 lens. There is of course a GPS, and Wi-Fi. I don't much use my camera as a compass, so this really wasn't a big deal for me. I can see where the Wi-Fi could come in useful for remotely controlling the camera.  Nikon has also added a number of new video formats. Admittedly at highest resolution you're going to generate some humongous file sizes. Even a short video can run 500 to 600 megs. I suspect most people would be happy with the 720 mode.I would not get too wrapped up in megapixel rating as the sensor sizes are generally very small in point and shoot cameras.  More megapixels does not necessarily equate to better images. In fact, it usually means more noise. I'm not sure how this camera stacks up against other point-and-shoot cameras in its class as most of my other gear is pro equipment. To me, I see a fair amount of noise even at ISO 400, but again I think this is pretty common for this price level camera.There's a number of things that do bother me about this camera. One is the zoom. I don't know if I have a defective camera, but the zoom is very jerky, and not smooth at all. Occasionally (Frequently)  it just zooms all the way out or all the way in instead of settling at an intermediate step. I'm going to contact Nikon about this as again, I may have a defective camera. I have been unable to take any professional looking, smooth videos.The focus is fairly fast. I will have to play a little bit with post production with the images, but the camera needs lots of light for best results.  I really would like to see an even faster lens. As to apertures, there is basically two. I believe it's 2.8 and 4.2. (Fireworks mode does stop the camera down more, but also changes the white balance). There is no way(mode)to stop the lens down further for greater depth of field or any kind of creative effects. The cameras is capable of slower shutter speeds, but you would have to put some neutral density filters in front of the lens if you want to access them for creative effects. I believe the Olympus has an advantage here.My understanding was that the older 110 model came with a filter adapter to allow you to use 40.5 mm filters, but this new does not include one. I'm not sure if they are available as an accessory or not.  There are quite a few \"Scene modes\" and then an easy auto if you really don't want to think about anything. Namely the camera will do its best, based on its programming, to get you a good picture. The auto mode (different than easy auto mode and scene mode) gives you much greater control, and you do have the option at least of turning the flash on and off, using fill-in flash, or slow sync, redeye reduction, timer, macro mode, etc. each scene mode add some kind of attribute. The party/event mode for example adds a redeye reduction, the close-up mode puts the camera into macro mode, the sports mode uses a high shutter speed, the fireworks mode turns off the auto white light balance, and puts the camera into a different color temperature and stops the lens down more and decreases shutter speed, the list goes on. The more you know about photography, the less you would be likely to use these modes, but I'm sure many people will appreciate them.If you're interested in more of the auto features I think these are very similar to the older model, and you can read about them in other reviews. I actually wish there was more manual control, but not very common with point-and-shoot style cameras. All the buttons are very small and pretty tough to read. I think you may be able to press the shutter release with a pair of gloves on, but other than that you would have to remove gloves to operate. Here again I think the Olympus has an edge.I was able to see the screen in sunlight, but it does tend to wash out. You can see well enough to compose your shot. I believe Nikon also attempted to improve the image stabilization as I see there is a \"hybird\" mode now. I really can't comment on how well it works over previous models, but my handheld videos look quite good.Color accuracy looks quite good, and I suspect resolution is decent for this class of camera. Again, don't be fooled by the 16 megapixel rating. My eight-year-Canon D-20 takes much better pictures at eight megapixel with less noise. Of course, this started out as a $1500 camera, so not exactly an apples to apples comparison.I would say for the price this camera has a lot of outstanding features. It's small, lightweight, has some pretty nice video with plenty of options, and image stabilization seems very good. The scene mode gives you loads to address most situations, but don't expect manual control here as you're not going to get any. I would say the still modes would give you good enough quality to produce a very nice 16 x 20 print. I even tried a 24 x 36 print last night and it held its own--impressive. The fill-in flash mode worked very well in my few test, whereas used as a main flash it's a bit harsh. Again, pretty typical for a point-and-shoot.I only tried a few underwater shots, and did not even have the camera set to the proper mode, and got some good results. I think this camera could easily replace something like a Go Pro, and you can actually frame and see what you're shooting! Overall I think it represents an excellent value. Oh, I will add that I accidentally dropped the camera from 4' (thought I had it attached to the tripod screw and did not-ooops!) and it bounced a couple of times on my laminate floor. Not even a scratch!I'm taking off one star for the very poor zoom function.if you would like to know about any specific feature please don't hesitate to post a comment.Beat out the Black addition of the Go Pro:See [....]", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nice", "unixReviewTime": 1394496000, "reviewTime": "03 11, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A2K41FNJIZUDAF", "asin": "B00IA9LVOC", "reviewerName": "K.

Books.\"", "helpful": [5, 6], "reviewText": "I did a bit of research before choosing the ASUS T100 2-in-1 (I'll just call it the T100 from now on). I wanted something useful, current and affordable. The T100 was the best choice, and it has received good reviews all over the Internet. I received mine a few days ago and, like many other reviewers, will share some tips and ideas. Many items below have been mentioned in other reviews here on Amazon, so thanks to those reviewers for their advice (of which I followed!). I've updated some information based on those tips as well.1. You'll be extremely eager to use your T100 out of the box. Don't. Use it, that is. You can be as eager as you want. The user manual -- apparently updated recently -- specifically states the device must be charged for a full 8 hours prior to use. Charge it. 8 hours. No less.2. My model, the T100-TA-H1-GR (32GB with 500GB hard drive), came with an AD adapter -- no USB adaptor as mentioned by others. The user manual -- very generic -- states that different models of the T100 come with different types of adapters. I'm perfectly fine with the AC adapter. It's a microUSB adapter, so many standard chargers will work. (Though the charging may dwindle to a slow trickle)3. Don't dis Windows 8.1. I've been using the Metro/Tiles screen, and I rather like it. You can easily switch back and forth between that view and the normal desktop, though. I've yet to confuse myself (and sometimes that's pretty easy to do). It also walks you through an insanely easy &#34;set up&#34; system the first time you log on. Just have your network password ready and your Windows account information if you have one.4. Check your BIOS version prior to doing anything else. Here's how you do this: Click the Start button, choose Run, and type in &#34;msinfo32&#34;. On the screen that pops up, one of the lines will list your current BIOS version. The latest ASUS  BIOS is 304, and that's what was installed on my system. In fact, everything ASUS was current.5. As stated in another review, you should go into your settings and change how Windows Updates works. Choose the &#34;download updates and let me choose whether to install them&#34;. This way, you can ensure you're plugged in and have enough power. When I first checked for updates, I had over 46. It took a while. And quite a few &#34;reboots.&#34; Once that's done, you can start having fun.6. Somebody mentioned a program called &#34;StartIsBack&#34;. It allows you a better Start menu in the desktop view. I tried it. Loved it. Bought it. It's currently only $2.99, and I think it's well worth the cost. At least until Windows fixes the Start menu.7. I think the 32GB version is plenty. Why? I have a 500GB hard drive and I also put a 64GB microSD card on the tablet portion. Important to note: If you detach the screen/tablet from the keyboard, you do NOT have access to the 500GB drive, so your apps and documents MUST be saved on that microSD card. 64GB is plenty of space for my music files, as my normal documents are all stored in the cloud (I use DropBox and much prefer it to the Microsoft OneDrive system).8. The touchpad and keyboard take some getting used to, but I've had zero issues with either. Again, know what you're buying. This is NOT a full-sized laptop.9. Get a stylus. Period.10. The screen resolution is FINE. I know this is a huge deal for many. If you're that hung up on it and you're a power user, why are you buying this in the first place? I Facebook, email, browse the web, listen to music, watch movies on Netflix, and sometimes use Office. This works great for all of those.11. Yes, the full version of Office 2013 (Home and Student) is included. This is a great deal, btw. You can use the Windows appstore for apps (hugely disappointed in their selections right now, though) or install full versions of software providing you have space on either the microSD card you install or the hard drive. For music, I have iTunes on the hard drive and use the Music app when I'm in Tablet mode. (My files, remember, are on the microSD card on the tablet portion).12. Get a good screen protector. While a case/cover isn't necessary (at least for me), a good screen protector is just a necessity with any piece of touchscreen technology.Main issues?1. The small keyboard. Not a design flaw, though. Merely getting my fingers in the habit of using a smaller keyboard!2. The tablet/on-screen keyboard is HUGE and I can't figure out how to change it or if that's even possible. Nor can you &#34;swype&#34; on it. (Though the handwriting feature is kinda neat.)3. The Windows app store is less than stellar. You can, though, have &#34;tiles&#34; for regular programs and files.If you're still unsure, go to a big-box retailer and check one out so you know what you'll be getting.

But I've had quibbles with all of them over time, and I'll go over some of those quibbles - and why they've been eliminated from the nearly perfect Harmony Ultimate One.The first quibble was size and feel. It was difficult to reach buttons on larger versions of the harmony without swinging it two-handed like a broadsword. This version is easy to manipulate, from top to bottom.The second was the touchscreen. With old Harmony remotes the odds you could get through a TV session without accidentally brushing the touchscreen and landing, inevitably, on channel 1 were next to nil. This one does an excellent job of disregarding inadvertent contact with the screen. In addition, the screen is much more useful, with swipe motions to go between the four major functions (touchpad, number pad, function screen and channel screen).The third was the setup. This is the main selling point for the Harmony, the ability to make all your devices function with one touch for an activity. Previously, this required a lot of manual finesse. One example: my receiver needs about 5 seconds after turning on to boot and receive additional commands. With the old remotes, I had to manually program in the delay. With the Ultimate One, the delay is accounted for.

I currently own and use a pair of Harmony One's as my 'go to ' remotes. They are VERY durable if properly cared for with one of my two 'One's&#8221; lasting more than 6 years old now and subjected to DAILY heavy use!  Needless to say I am a Harmony fan and was eager to try this new Harmony Ultimate One out and see how it stacks up against my beloved original Harmony One.Before reading more you may wish to read this disclaimer:&#8220;These remotes are NOT for the technically challenged OR the chronically impatient! The website/software that allows you to custom program your Harmony Ultimate remote features unlimited combinations that you can use for both your devices and your &#8220;Activities&#8221; (macros), but also features one of the WORST software interfaces currently in use.  It took me a good few months to find my way around the software enough to get fast with it. At this point it is all 2nd nature to me but honestly if you are not willing to spend the time and trouble on Harmony programming, you most likely should look elsewhere. On the other hand if you are willing to learn and spend a bit of trial and error time, you will be greatly rewarded with a remote that controls all your devices exactly the way YOU want it to.&#8221;Ok, end of disclaimer.......  Now back to my review.........This particular Harmony is the IR model and will not shoot commands through solid objects, etc. This is for 'Line of Sight&#8221; control.*** You can upgrade this remote by buying the Smart Control unit which will add RF capability to this , and more.The until itself is very well made. It is smaller and lighter than my original Harmony One. Like the original 'One', it is rechargeable and includes a recharging base. You can control All your devices (up to 15) and create custom &#8220;Activities&#8221; to turn any number of devices on/off and change them to the appropriate inputs in one button push.  All the functions work as advertised, although the gesture control will take a bit of getting used to. I am sure it will be a very fast way to do certain things, once I get the knack.  Smart Phone users should have no trouble at all using the touch screen and the associated gesture controls.Honestly, for what it is, the new Harmony Ultimate One remote works exceedingly well.  I have a complex system consisting of up to 9 devices and have encountered ZERO programming/operational glitches.  What I mean to say is that IT WORKS!I honestly only have one major complaint/problem with this remote.....While I like this new Harmony Ultimate One, in my opinion it is far from BEING ultimate.  I still consider the original Harmony One (discontinued model) to be the best product they have ever turned out.  Here is the main reason:Basically the Harmony line of remotes underwent a drastic layout change just a few years back. The greatly loved classic configuration of the button/touchscreen layout was scrapped and replaced with new models that moved the touchscreen to the center of the remote and the most used transport buttons to the top. This just a plain bad idea when it comes to ease of use.  It is just too easy to activate the touch screen on the way up to your transport controls and when you DO wish to use the touchscreen, functions that USED to be controlled by dedicated buttons are now requiring a glance or two to operate. I am spoiled and used to using my Harmony One by touch alone, but that doesn't cut it with touchscreens.. Also, having to reach to the very top for transport functions is uncomfortable at best and at times requites two hands instead of one. (at least for me it does)&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;Sigh&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;  Oh well, I am sure Logitech has heard this from MANY people already, but my feeling is IF they could give back the classic button layout while still shrinking the product, they would have a real winner.IF you have never used an original Harmony One or are NEW to Harmony remotes, then this new Harmony One Ultimate should both please you and serve all your remote needs with ease.  BUT if you are like me and are still clinging to the older version, you are bound to miss the classic button layout with the touch screen at the top. It really IS the best layout and for many, many reasons. Be that as it may, THIS is the new top of the line for Harmony remotes and while I don't find the layout  easier to use, it IS well made and all the functions remain, just implemented differently and found in different places on the physical remote itself.AS you have probably surmised, I am a real Harmony Fan.  The day I put away all my remotes for good was one to remember. I even use my Harmony to turn on/off and adjust my AC and room lighting. The Logitech database is vast and you will most likely find ALL your devices on it.If you want to control ALL your devices with one remote and be able to make totally customizable control layouts and multi-device macros, then this Harmony One Ultimate will bend to your will. You just need a bit of patience and determination, plus a touch of imagination to turn this remote into YOUR Ultimate remote.Again, I don't care for the new design, but this device is top of the line with great construction, good looks, and the ability to perform each and every function on every electronic device you currently use for stereo/home theater.As such, it IS recommended by ME, Marty G !", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good Solid Unit!

Nobody knows!It took a week for support to figure out that the behavior was &#34;normal function&#34;?  What kind of management does not supply Support with with proper information or provides it with believable answers.Also, I'd like to ask the designers why the heck they want the item burning electricity needlessly. If the backlight coming back on while on the charger it's meant to be a night light, then why isn't it lit the whole time that the unit is on the charger? If it's meant to indicate that charging is complete or some such thing, then why have such an indication when the instructions that come with the remotes say, &#34;leave on charger whenever not in use so you know where to find the remote.&#34;This is situation is at best downright silly no matter how you try to look at it.If you can live with all that, and are well healed, this might be a prudent way to cut down on all those remotes.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Works reasonably well-- A few important caveats--Support is wicked unknowledgable", "unixReviewTime": 1403481600, "reviewTime": "06 23, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "ATOKT8QYK967L", "asin": "B00IAKLM54", "reviewerName": "Steve B \"Mac User\"", "helpful": [7, 8], "reviewText": "Like most people I hate having seven remotes to control my system so combining them into one unit is a great idea. I appreciate the opportunity to review the Ultimate One and compare it to my two-year-old One with the failing buttons. Although the Ultimate One is pretty smart and quite functional in many ways, Logitech misses the mark for me on several important points.Software: Try finding Roku for the Harmony. There are several classifications to look under but none of them make sense for Roku. It's listed under &#34;DVD.&#34; Go figure. Try Apple TV. Good luck with that one. Brand new hardware (Ultimate One) with the same old crappy software. If they spent a couple of days with a new software team leader in charge, maybe they'd come up with a better system, but this one has irritated me since I bought the old One more than two years ago.Hardware: Improved the shape and size over the old One so that now it stands up in the charging stand, taking up much less room on the table where it sits. Also added a textured back to make it easier to grip. They got rid of the superfluous buttons that cluttered up the old One, but also removed some pretty useful ones. These buttons are now accessed through layers of a touch screen. Sometimes this works out well, and sometimes not. Really depends on your equipment and the type of controlling you need to do. For me, I still keep the original remotes close enough that I can use them to do the more intricate things I don't want to bother setting up and troubleshooting on the Harmony. Yes, troubleshoot. Not everything works right the first time.Some inconveniences: Ever hand your remote to someone so they can control things? Well, be careful with the Ultimate. About 1/4 times one of us will accidentally activate something on the touchscreen during transfer from one hand to the other, and we're being careful. Also, for some reason they put the playback buttons (play, FF, REW, etc) above the touchscreen. Try using those without activating something on the touchscreen!Set up: Since I already had a Harmony One that was fine-tuned to my system (which took months to finesse!!!), set up was just a matter of transferring the information from the One to the Ultimate. Easy-cheesy. I don't look forward to learning how to set up the Ultimate for a new piece of equipment after seeing that the software is still the same: lame. For now, the Ultimate controls most things fine with no fuss on my part.If you want to get rid of all of your remotes the Ultimate One could be your solution. For me it wasn't. If you want the convenience of controlling most of the common functions of a lot of equipment and don't mind the limitations, then this expensive remote could be a great addition to your collection. We now have nine remotes instead of the seven that came with the equipment. The old One is still on the charger for my wife's use (she doesn't care for the lack of buttons on the Ultimate). The Ultimate is for me, most of the time. The individual equipment remotes are stashed close-by in case I need to access something I can't find on the Ultimate.If Logitech would update their software to the 21st century (they still have Laserdisc but don't have a proper category for ROKU) and put the touch screen at the top with all of the buttons grouped together, I'd love the Ultimate One. If they don't make changes to the software I won't buy a new One when this One wears out.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Great idea; poor engineering", "unixReviewTime": 1398643200, "reviewTime": "04 28, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A145B8OHVNNFAJ", "asin": "B00IAKLM54", "reviewerName": "Steward Willons", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "For virtually everyone, this is the only universal remote you will ever need. With it&#8217;s huge database of remote codes, the possibilities are almost limitless. Unfortunately for me, I ran into one of these rare exceptions when I upgraded to a state-of-the-art LG TV with a crazy, voice-activated remote. I guess this means I&#8217;m stuck using two remotes for the foreseeable future, if I want to take full advantage of my new TV&#8217;s remote. Talk about your first world problems! Seriously though, until I got this weird new remote, the Harmony Ultimate One was perfect, and seeing as most people aren&#8217;t going to run into this issue, the LHUO (Logitech Harmony Ultimate One) is everything you will ever need.One initial point of clarification, since it has seemed to provoke confusion amongst inattentive shoppers: This is an IR remote, not an RF remote. That means that you need a clear line of sight between the LHUO and the component it is controlling. It won&#8217;t shoot through an opaque cabinet door. If you want that functionality, Logitech makes an RF version of the LHUO, although it sells for almost $100 more. There are a handful of electronics that use RF instead of IR. The Dish Network remote is an RF remote, so that&#8217;s an important exception to be aware of. Otherwise, IR works just fine for most people. Seriously, if you can&#8217;t be bothered to keep your cabinet doors open, then you probably won&#8217;t mind spending extra for the convenience of RF.Every setup is different, but I&#8217;ll describe mine here as briefly as possible. The specifics of what I&#8217;m doing with the remote are, obviously, less important than the overall idea of how much it can do. I have a TV, a Blu-ray player, a DVD player (it&#8217;s a long story why this is still part of my setup), an A/V receiver, and an Apple TV. It&#8217;s a pretty standard setup, but it involved me using five different remotes, which is a drag. The LHUO took care of all of them with ease. Programming the remote on my Mac was incredibly easy. Everything just worked. It was such a non-issue, that I don&#8217;t feel compelled to write much more about it!As for the physical aspects of the remote, I must say that it&#8217;s fantastic. It&#8217;s weighted nicely for perfect balance and feels substantial without being heavy. Basically, it feels like a well-made product. You might think this is totally secondary to its functionality, but since we spend so much time holding remotes, having something this well designed does make a difference.The buttons are clear, the layout makes sense, and it&#8217;s not packed full of obscure, unlabeled buttons. I&#8217;ve seen a lot of universal remotes that give you tons of assignable buttons, but realistically, there are only so many functions you can remember when something isn&#8217;t labeled. Picture yourself as a technophobic spouse, and that number drops even more. Every button needs to have a function that is intuitively expressed through its labeling if anyone other than you will use it.If you&#8217;re a guy (yes, it&#8217;s a cultural stereotype, but chances are, if you&#8217;re reading this, you are in fact a guy), you probably have a wife or girlfriend who wants to watch TV occasionally in your absence. Whether she embraces technology or not, if she didn&#8217;t program it, she&#8217;s going approach this with skepticism. I&#8217;ve seen my parents go through this song and dance many times. My dad thinks his new universal remote is the most intuitive thing in the world and my mom is so turned off by it that she uses all the old remotes both out of stubbornness and out of necessity. The beauty here is that there are actually very few buttons on the remote. Everything makes sense, just by looking at it. If you hand this to someone who didn&#8217;t program it, they&#8217;re probably going to be able to figure it out. That&#8217;s a design element that is almost invaluable.The touch screen works well, and this is probably why the remote can afford to be so simple. If there are weird features that you don&#8217;t need to access regularly, you can tuck them away in the touch screen menus - a place most other users (other than yourself) will ever need to venture. The only downside here is that the remote needs a lot of power to function. I prefer the simplicity of a basic, battery powered remote. The LHUO needs a docking station to function because it&#8217;s rechargeable batter needs to stay juiced. You don&#8217;t need to keep it in the dock all the time, and the charge actually lasts quite a while. But, you do need to have the dock accessible periodically and that means an extra power supply and an extra cable. It could be worse; the dock is minimal and looks decent. I just wish I didn&#8217;t need yet another piece of gear to tuck away somewhere.Overall, the LHUO is an incredibly well designed piece of gear. It&#8217;s well built, it&#8217;s easy to program, and most importantly, it&#8217;s intuitive enough for other users to grasp. I cannot over emphasize enough how important usability is for people who are not yourself. You&#8217;re awesome; you&#8217;re buying a universal remote. You&#8217;re excited about programming it, and you&#8217;re dedicated to learning how to use it most effectively. Everyone else just wants to watch TV in the simplest way possible. This actually IS simple enough that they won&#8217;t protest. Buy it for the functionality, but also buy it for the clean, logical layout.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Intuitive and easy to use", "unixReviewTime": 1398211200, "reviewTime": "04 23, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A2CUWCJHUPGL9W", "asin": "B00IAV4S1I", "reviewerName": "Kiki", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "This is a pretty amazingly powerful computer.

It has an AMD dual graphics are very nice, but many games (particularly on Steam) are powered by Nvidia (like Planetside 2), so there might be some graphics glitches.The camera is ok for skyping and basic needs.Audio is excellent, but it is still a laptop, so my son was a little surprised.

Using center points on both my 5d3 and 6d it's accurate, but if you use any outer points on either it results in front focusing. Before I get grilled, in terms of the 5d3 I use only cross type outer points, not the last single orientation row, though I have additionally tried those as well, and they too yield the same results.  AFMA can't fix it because the center and out point calibration is off. It is not my cameras as they work perfectly with all my other lenses, and I have tested my friend's sigma 50 art on both of my cameras and it does not have this issue and focuses perfectly at all points on both cameras. I don't know if I'm just extremely unlucky, or what because I have not heard anybody else make this observation with theirs. Sigma: how many of these do I have to buy before I end up with a copy without focus problems? The optics are stunning and I don't want to give up on it, but I'm getting really tired of buying and returning, and I'm sure the dealers are not enjoying the process either.*****UPDATEI spent two weeks almost waiting for sigma to repair this lens, only to receive a phone call saying they do not have the parts necessary, that it would take 4-6 weeks at the earliest before they can get the parts, and that I should return the lens to the dealer. Now I'm cutting it extremely close to the return date limit. How can you put products on the market without having the parts to repair them? My rating has changed to two stars. The lens itself would be a 5 if I had received a perfectly functioning copy, but because I got a lemon, and waited two weeks to hear the bad news from Sigma's service center, the lens gets a two- because part of buying a product is the service and support you receive from the company that makes it. Now even if I manage to return the lens on time, there aren't any in stock to rebuy and the price has since gone up by $100.Not happy.*******The optics are second to none. Very sharp, the colors and contrast are amazing, and the flare resistance is incredible. However, my copy is having focusing problems. On my 5d mark iii, the center points work just fine most of the time, but the outer points result in a heavy front focusing. If you AFMA the outer points (though even +20 isn't quite enough), it throws the center points off, so it's not a user fixable issue. On my other camera, a 6d, some times it doesn't seem to need AFMA, other times +8 seems to make it better, some times that same +8 seems to make it worse, etc. However, if I use this lens on my 6d in SERVO focusing, I've had pretty good results with all focus points. Strange, but I need it to work consistently in all focusing modes, and on both cameras! I have done tripod mounted controlled tests with both cameras so no, it's not user error (before somebody tries to lecture me by restating a bunch of stuff they read online somewhere).I am sending this lens to sigma, I will report back when I receive it. I have not heard of others with issues yet, but there aren't many of these out.

I was willing to take the risk knowing the local store would stand behind the sale. I tested all of the issues others have reported (including the DVD reader - no problems) it works seamlessly.It is about 2 pounds heavier than my other computer (full weight is 5.4 pounds), but that is because it is LARGER than the other one. I love the nice bright screen, and am enjoying being able to read \"stuff\" better than a smaller screen. Unlike some, I use my laptop at home most of the time, and 2 pounds isn't a big deal.My last one was an ultra - I love having this one where I can replace the battery myself and have a spare on hand for long trips. I really do love having the Superdrive, meaning I can watch a DVD, play a CD, import songs, burn CDs. You don't realize how often you want these features until you have a computer without it.It responds slightly more slowly than the Lenovo I had, but well within tolerable allowances. I notice it most on loading internet pages. But slightly means just a tiny bit. It takes about four seconds longer to start up following a restart.It has a full keyboard, with a 10-key pad on the right. The keyboard is \"flat\" without raised keys, but have a slightly raised point on the J and F keys making it easy to find your spot.The touchpad (I use a trackball because of carpal tunnel) is configured the way I prefer, with the two buttons on the bottom.I used the memory card reader to transfer some files (some by Drop Box) and it read the card rapidly and transferred the files quickly. I am happy with that.With three USB ports, I can easily keep my trackball at hand and yet charge my iPhone if I want, and still have room to pop in a flash drive. Only one of the USB ports is 3.0, and you can change the setting to make it into a 2.0 if you want to save battery time.The screen is bright, and I am very happy with it.

Yes the color was amazing, I loved the almost 3D depth perception and was truly impressed with the up scaling of non 4K material. Not sure if it was the curved screen or advanced technology that seemed to give this set a brilliance less evident on other 4K flat screen TV's on view. But then the screen turned to a full black background and there it was.... any light in the room was reflected on the screen causing a slight cast of an almost rainbow effect running across the set horizontally. At first I figured it wouldn't be an issue because how often does one view a totally black screen? But then I noticed reoccurring light reflections regardless of the screen content. I asked the salesman about it and he said all the new 2014 Samsung models had a reflection problem compared to the 2013 and earlier models. In fact he beamed a flashlight on other sets and all you saw was the white pin light reflected from the bulb. He then shined it on this model and besides the white bulb reflection you now saw three rings of rainbow colors encircling the pin light. Not good. Unfortunately Samsung wanted the set displayed at the entry way of the TV/Audio department where there was an abundance of store lights reflecting off it. Had it been displayed in a darker area I doubt I would have been as aware of its flaw. However I am concerned about what it will look like in my living room on a sunny day.

The only bottleneck in its performance was the GPU, an Nvidia GT610. Flash forward to early 2014. I too read all the technology articles about this card, calling it an Xbox killer, PS4 slasher, all of that. \"Plays Titanfall better than Xbox One at 1080p\" was a frequent comment made by journalists referring to this card. I let the hype build in me until I finally decided to put my tax return towards this card. Is it as good as you'd think? Let's discuss pros and cons.PROS:-Price point. $150 is super cheap for this level performance, though I imagine with Bitcoin miners becoming more common, and with more people finding out about this card, the price will rise. (I paid around $140 for mine.) I was happier than a kid on Christmas in 1996 when I finally got it, and could see what it could do.-Graphics capabilities. This card WILL run just about everything on high/ultra settings at 1080p with minimal optimization and minimal lag. Battlefield 3/4 on Ultra at 1080p, clocked it at 35-55fps. Similar performance from Metro 2033/Last Light on High. Skyrim maxed out at just under 60fps. It does it all and with such ease.-Runs cool/low power consumption. I have never seen this card heat up above 35-40C. My case fans seem to run quieter as well, since the large fan on this card effectively disperses heat and helps keep parts cool. The card itself only draws 60w of power which is very convenient, and only has a minimum power supply wattage requirement of 300w, which, in this day and age, likely comes with a very modest store bought desktop, if that.-Not noisy. I don't know what other reviewers are talking about... this card has the quietest fan out of my whole rig. My old graphics card (Nvidia GT610) was exponentially louder. The fan is large and actually takes up most of the card. You can control the speed of the fan in percentages, using the included software (discussed below.)-Maxwell architecture. Maxwell is Nvidia's newest card architecture, which allows the card to run 2x more efficiently than last generation's Kepler architecture, with less than half of the power consumption. This is the first card available with that architecture and I imagine many more cards will adopt it in the future, until the next generation of Nvidia cards comes out (with something even better :P)-Ease of installation/use. The card doesn't run on external power, which is one of the main reasons I bought it. Simply take out your old card, pop the new one into the PCI-Express slot, and hook it up to your monitor. You're all ready to go. Took me less than 5 minutes to set up the new card. Pop it in, boot up your computer, install the drivers and boom. Prepare yourself for glorious gaming.-Nvidia Shadowplay support. The 700 family of Nvidia's GPUs all support Nvidia Shadowplay, which is currently in beta. Shadowplay is a video recording software, similar to Fraps or DXTory, but unlike those programs which record video from the CPU, lowering framerates and clogging up hard drives with large file sizes, Shadowplay records video from your GPU itself directly, at 1080p (with an option for other resolutions like 240/480/720/in-game,) without an FPS counter or any watermarks, and at incredibly small file sizes! This is a huge thing for gamers, especially those who like to record themselves.-Ease of overclocking. The card itself ships with EVGA's proprietary software, \"EVGA Precision X.\" It's a powerful program that allows you to boost the performance of your card and tweak just about every feature. It's very useful and helps you to overclock your card (though the SuperClock edition of the 750ti has a higher base block, which is why I bought it.)CONS:-None. Owned the card for a little over a week now with no problems. It not only lived up to all of my expectations but totally surpassed them, blowing them away into the dust. This card will do it all, and with no problems. It represents a phenomenal value in performance graphics cards. For the PC gamer on a budget, I would recommend this card as it will hold its value and performance for the years to come. If you want all the horsepower like the big boys, but don't want to spend a fortune on a racecar, this card is what you're looking for.Kudos to Nvidia for their revolutionary, exceptional card, and as always, EVGA delivers a consistent, high quality OEM card with the modern PC gamer in mind.

I think this is their first spin with the current process, and performance-wise fits into the 7-series right at the number the card has.  I think with the shrink we will see a similar (and probably a little faster) version of this card as the 850.  The level of performance is good, but in terms of the power and heat...it's among the best out there.It is very low power, but the performance is good enough for 1080p at a good frame rate with today's games.  I got this card for my Linux box, and with the 331.49 Linux 64-bit driver the card is detected correctly, and works just great, even in demanding games like Metro Last Light; at 1920*1200 the frame rate was smooth with nearly maximum settings (for Linux at least).  Driver support is of course very new (it wasn't correctly detected in the 331.20 set) so performance could very well improve even more.  So, basically even though you need Windows according to the box, the card works just fine in 64-bit Linux (both Ubuntu 12.04 and 13.10).The card itself is very small and light.  It's not really very loud either.  There is no 6-pin connector; it draws all power through the slot.  Some cards are sold with that connector, but I think even with a high overclock, you may not even need it.  As to overclocking, I use it in Linux so I can't tell you that...but this is the superclocked version so it will run at over 1200Mhz boosted easily, as indicated in the specifications.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very happy with it so far.

It does what it does, and it does it pretty well.The rubbery feel works well.  When closed up, it carries well, and has just enough texture and friction to be firm and have a &#34;good grip&#34; feel, but not be annoying.  The flap seems to protect the screen adequately enough, and while I was concerned about the magnet being a problem, it doesn't seem to be an issue at all.When carrying the tablet with the cover open, like in a meeting or class and you're taking notes, the cover feels lose when it is fully open.  Its actually quite uncomfortable.  What I notice I do is that I fold back the first portion of the flap, and that tightens things up nicely, and gives my fingers something quite handy to grip with, once again giving me the &#34;I have a good grip&#34; feel that it has when its closed.  Until I figured that out, though... I was highly annoyed.  =]The stand aspect of the cover is nice.  It holds the device upright quite firmly. I put a bluetooth keyboard in front, and type away, and it works like a charm.  I also can flip up just the first flap, and then its largely laying down, but at an angle... that lets me use the onscreen keyboard and the pen with relative comfort, while still tilting the tablet toward me... I actually do that the most as far as standing it up goes.  The full upright position is very handy for watching movies, and skyping and stuff.The sides of the device are well protected, and the notches are more than adequate to provide access to the various ports and buttons and whatnot.  When the flap is flipped back behind, you can access the SD Card without removing the device from the cover, but with it closed, it is well protected from popping out.  (I had a tablet do that once to me, which is why I bring it up)I had some concern when I first put it on about heat, but it seems to transfer heat just fine, and it has not been an issue at all.In short, I like it.  Its hard to get excited about a cover, because if they do what they do well, then you don't really think about them much.  I sort of think if it as part of my tablet... as if it came that way.I'm very happy with it, and it seems to be holding up very well - I use this thing literally every day, for most of the day, and I carry my device everywhere.

It's not only compact but its ergonomics is such that it will allow you very quick and easy access to your camera. This camera bag definitely has a few very nifty features that I love. I do, however, have a couple of complaints:1) The compartments can't be configured to hold a larger lens. For example, it won't hold my Canon EF 100-400mm f/5.6 lens (even with the lens hood off). This camera bag may not be well suited for bird and wildlife photographers and portrait photographers who use a bigger portrait lens such as the Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8. Still, the bag is very practical for landscape photography -- and that's what I'll be using this bag primarily for.2) Tripods (save for the ultra compact and lightweight tripods like thisSlik Sprint Mini II Tripod) cannot be securely strapped onto the side. The paltry single tripod strap on the side of the camera bag gives larger tripods plenty of wiggle room and that's definitely not something you want while you're on the go.In all other respects, I'd have to say Case Logic has done an incredible job in making this camera bag very, very user friendly:= ErgonomicsThe camera bag has strategically placed handle bars that allow you to steady the camera bag with one hand while the other hand is able to quickly zip or unzip a compartment. The operation of the zippers to all compartments is very, very smooth. All zippers have these very distinctive zipper pulls that make reaching for a zipper to zip or unzip a compartment BY FEEL uncannily quick and effortless.= CompactnessThe camera bag measures 9\" x 6\" x 14\" (L x W x H). Its compact size is ideal for the photography who doesn't want to be bogged down by clunky and unwieldy camera equipment while on the go. Wildlife and landscape photographers and photographers who want to travel light will appreciate the mobility this camera bag affords them over traditional camera bags.= ProtectivenessThe camera bag is well-padded all around to protect your camera and lenses from some bumps, or even a short drop.= CompartmentsNow, let talk compartments:- Main (Side) CompartmentThe main compartment will hold a full size DSLR (e.g. Canon 5D Mark III) with a larger walk-around lens (e.g. Canon EF 24-70mm f/2.8) plus one or two smaller lenses.- Top CompartmentThe top compartment will hold batteries, cleaning implements (lens pen, lens blowers, microfiber cloth, etc), and a few other odds and ends. Within the this compartment is a zippered compartment for your filters and memory cards,- Back CompartmentThe back compartment is big enough for a good-sized tablet (possibly a smaller notebook). It measures 8\" x 11\".- Tripod CompartmentThe tripod strap will securely hold an ultra compact and lightweight tripod.= RainflyThe camera bag comes with a rainfly stowed on the bottom of the unit will keep your camera equipment dry in the event of rain.---As an avid hiker and photographer, I will be using this camera bag for taking my equipment with me while I'm on shorter (~10-mile or less) hikes. I had never been a fan of the single should sling camera bags, but after using this Case Logic bag, I have become a convert!The Verdict: If you're looking for a compact camera bag that will hold a bigger camera lens, this camera bag will unfortunately not fit the bill.

This latest from Samsung is an excellent 27&#34; model that is so thin and light with such a small bezel that compared to its immediate predecessors looks like it's actually smaller even though it was a couple inches larger diagonally.I had been trying to use a recent 32&#8221; Samsung LED TV as a monitor but ultimately that was a bit tough on the eyes with the 1080P resolution that close on a monitor/TV that large.  So I hunted around and when I saw these new monitors from Samsung at the incredible intro price of 279 I wanted to jump on it, the pricing seems to alternate every few months between the 279 and 329.These are Samsung&#8217;s PLS panel tech, their take on IPS so the color reproduction and viewing angles are much better than the cheaper TFTs.  The screen is matte though the bezel is a bit glossy.I was very pleased w/ the default color temperature and saturation, it was not too &#8216;cool&#8217; as some prior ones had been and additionally there were no dead pixels, woo hoo.  I&#8217;ve got the brightness still set to 100 although I&#8217;ve seen some folks have turned that down.So far no noticeably bad ghosting when gaming.  I do classic arcade/computer emulation with MAME and MESS and vertical arcade games will have pillarboxes on the sides and these are nice and black.

Let me start with the good aspects that I discovered.There are the now-standard optical, RCA and line-in connections. There are only one of each. The Bluetooth, SD/MMC card reader, FM radio and USB add some additional flexibility which was nice. Connection from my TV with the included RCA cables was a breeze. The optical cable is not included, but setup was just as easy. I had no problems pairing my phone and my tablet to the sound bar via Bluetooth. The SD/MMC card reader, as well as the USB connection is located on the end of the bar for easy access should you mount this on the wall.Now, the items that were not as good:If you are planning on using the line-in connection for devices, wall mounting may provide a hindrance as the connection is on the back of the sound bar. This may not be an issue if you don't use this input, or if you don't mind a cable hanging out the back and dangling on the wall. FM radio was a little tricky to program the presets. It wasn't too bad, though, after reading the instructions. The volume of sound generated is somewhat lacking. If you are in a room larger than a standard bedroom, or a dorm room, it might not be enough.  While the mid and high ranges are crisp and clean sounding, at higher volumes, the sound starts to distort. It has a built in subwoofer, but It would benefit from a dedicated subwoofer for some solid low end rumble. The remote is fairly easy to use, but the range on it is horrible. I had problems getting the sound bar to respond to the remote at just over 10 feet away.Overall, this is a good option for a budget minded purchase as long as you temper your expectations.

I've been building systems for over 20 years now, and I think I had more trouble getting an OS installed on this board than any other I've worked with.  To be fair, it's a system with no optical drive built in (so I was installing from a bootable DVD in a USB attached optical drive), but it still gave me a lot more trouble than anticipated.Based on other recommendations, I first tried to upgrade the BIOS.  However, the BIOS doesn't have an upgrade option in the BIOS setup, and it is a pain booting a flash drive on here, particularly with the shipping BIOS I received.  First it had to be configured to boot legacy storage instead of UEFI, then I had to reboot it again to get it to recognize the flash drive, then reconfigure how it treated the flash drive (floppy disk vs hard disk vs optical drive).  Never mind the hassle just making a bootable MS-DOS USB flash drive in the first place.  After getting the BIOS flashed, then the next trouble was getting it to boot a USB optical drive.  Again, had to tinker with various options for UEFI vs legacy (in this case, booting it UEFI vs the flash drive which was legacy).Other bizarre behavior I've had I'm not sure whether to attribute to the board, Windows Server 2012 R2, or some combination of both.  For example, occasionally on some reboots my drives show up with RAW partitions when I know those partitions were formatted ReFS.  At first I noticed it only on my external USB 3TB drive, and figured maybe there was some wonkiness there, but it's now done it with internal drives as well.  Given I've never seen another server build which does that, I'm leaning towards some bizarre interaction with the board.Also, while I didn't bump into an issue, be wary of the memory voltage.  I've heard of other reports of people having issues with 1.5V memory.  I can't confirm those for myself, but opted for 1.35V memory to be safe.The board itself does seem well enough constructed though, has been stable.  It isn't the fastest machine out there (by a long, long ways), but that's expected - it's dual-core, not a fast clock speed, and not running a CPU that's the most efficient clock-for-clock in the first place.  As long as your expectations are reasonable though, it performs fine.In the end, since I'm out of my return period, I'm considering this a sunk cost, and buying a different board.  I've got an i5-3570K sitting around from another system, so I'm picking up an LGA 1155 mini ITX board, accepting that I'll need a fan on the CPU, and calling it a day.

The Bluetooth matching is seamless. The reach is quite strong. It certainly goes at least 30 feet. To some extent, it can even work through the separation of walls, though I found that the signal could be lost from one room to another. As a practical matter, though, the speaker is so light that there's no problem moving it from room to room.The sound quality is excellent. Philips has not disappointed in this. The bass is very good for a such a small speaker.Perhaps the most telling, recurring criticisms from some Amazon.com reviewers relate to the power supply.The speaker does consume batteries at a rather rapid rate. One might install rechargeable batteries. They tend to be expensive and limited in performance, so that's not ideal. Depending on your needs, it's important to understand that there's not a built-in recharge capacity as with some portable speakers.The practical effect of this is to limit the real-time capacity of this speaker as truly portable. Given the battery consumption, one would likely not want to deploy it for regular use outdoors or other places without access to electric outlets.The portability is also limited by the design and construction of the speaker. Its size is just large enough so that it would be pretty challenging to carry in a small bag or case. So, too, it doesn't strike me as sturdy enough to put through the rigors of travel.On the other hand, for regular use in a home or office, using an electrical outlet, this unit can be a good choice.In the end, perhaps one should factor in the various compromises that various speakers include: cost, power, design and construction, sound quality.For many people who use this Philips product in one setting, this can be a versatile, high-quality, low-cost speaker.If you want durable portability--including smaller size, tight design, rechargeable power, good sound--you may want to compare this with other options. They will generally have higher price tags.In sum, for the uses as outlined, this is a fine product. Whether it's the best fit for you is about your needs every bit as much as the it's about the speaker.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent Product -- Think About What May Work Best for You", "unixReviewTime": 1405987200, "reviewTime": "07 22, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A1VBDMNT6I8RE5", "asin": "B00IG54NXG", "reviewerName": "Katharena M.

Includes NFC pairing, stream music from your phone wirelessly over Bluetooth for effortless enjoyment. It also charges any smart device using USB.Notes after using the Philips SB365/37 Wireless Bluetooth Portable Speaker for a couple of weeks:In the Box one finds the Philips SB365/37 Wireless Bluetooth Portable Speaker, AC Power adaptor with 6' cable, an 18&#34; 3.5mm Audio-in cable and a Short user manual containing the serial and model numbers, plus a link to a dot com support page with lots of detailed information -- which is an added Plus.Weighing in at a mere 1.4 pounds, the (4 x 10 x 4 inch) Black Philips SB365/37 Wireless Bluetooth Portable Speaker is made of a very hard plastic (on top and bottom) with a metal mesh covering the speakers and surrounding the rest of the unit. Both metal and plastic have a satin-like finish that resists fingerprints.  All the corners are rounded and very smooth. The bottom, of the unit, has 6 slip-resistant dots -- which grip very well on a (dry) smooth surface.The instruction pamphlet is easy to follow -- graphics are large, clear and bright. Wording is concise. I like that -- even if one has never &#34;Paired&#34; with BlueTooth or doesn't know what NFC technology (for fuss-free and easy usage) pairing is! :)With this unit, one either uses AC Power with the included AC adaptor (which has a polarized plug -- one blade is wider than the other), or inserts four fresh AA batteries (not included) in the battery compartment on the bottom of the unit. The speaker will automatically go into Stand-by mode if there is no BlueTooth connection, or audio input, for more than 15 minutes.On the top of the speaker one finds the Power On/Off (green LED when on -- fades slightly when in Stand-by mode), Bluetooth indicator (which is a blue LED -- flashes when searching for BlueTooth/NFC unit to pair with...stops flashing when Paired), Volume +/- and a good sized NFC receptor icon. All buttons are flat. There is a slightly audible click when pressing the Power and Volume control buttons. On the backside, of the unit, one finds the 3.5mm Audio plug-in, a USB (for charging Only) port and a DC In port (this is where the included AC Adaptor plugs in).  The bottom, of the unit houses a 4x AA battery compartment. That's It!Android OP (new Samsung Smart devices) and laptops using Windows8 were used for this review:  following directions, Pairing with BlueTooth, or NFC, was Super Fast. I needed to swipe (instead of Tap) My NFC enabled SmartPhones, but the connection was made, and the device stayed connected. note:  The speaker can memorize a maximum of 4 paired devices.One can use the Philips SB365/37 Wireless Bluetooth Portable Speaker as an external speaker with non Bluetooth audio devices by jacking into the earbud/headphone connection, of said device, with a 3.5 mm audio cable (included) and then into the Audio In port on the back of the speaker. When this is done, one simply controls the speaker via the settings on the linked into device.The, very handy, USB (for charging Only) port quickly charged all My Smart Devices and little mp3 players (that are not so Smart).I found the sound delivered through the Philips SB365/37 Wireless Bluetooth Portable Speaker, with NFC, to be phenomenal over a wide range of musical genre. Crystal clear highs, lows, bass and voice. The Bass Reflex Speaker System delivers a powerful, deeper bass. It can be very loud, if that is what one wishes.*smiles, sips espresso*Does the Philips SB365/37 Wireless Bluetooth Portable Speaker, with NFC, sound like what you may be looking for? :)  Would make a Fantastic Gift!

The picture quality difference is immediately obvious even on just digital cable channels which I really wasn't expecting. As others have stated setup is quick, easy and cute with it's childish cartoon graphics. I had no problem finding my 5ghz wireless N network.

I&#8217;ve had a fairly nice Samsung for years, and I always always happy with the picture quality, but the LG is even nicer, I think. The picture is brilliant, clear, bright - pretty much everything you want in a TV. The colors seem natural. It works in all light levels. The viewing angles are impressive. It basically looks the same no matter where you position yourself.  I have absolutely no complaints.I&#8217;ve noticed some reviewers commenting on uneven backlighting, weird color artifacts, and some sort of dimming issues. I&#8217;ve not experienced any of these. The picture looks great all the way to the edges. The TV will change the brightness level of the backlight in accordance with the ambient light of the room, and this can be annoying. The solution is easy: if you turn off the energy saving feature, the screen maintains a constant backlight level, and the dimming issues go away. You&#8217;re using more energy, but the picture is consistent.Sound Quality -Does anyone seriously use the built-in TV speakers? I see people complaining about the TV speakers, but common - don&#8217;t blame the LG. I&#8217;ve never seen a TV with good built-in speakers. They play loud enough to be usable, but they&#8217;re not amazing. Who cares. It&#8217;s like complaining that the speakers on your laptop don&#8217;t have enough bass.Remote -The remote is pretty cool. Instead of limiting you to a four-direction arrow key thing, you get a wii-mote-style cursor that allows you to click wherever you want. This is really nice because it saves you so many clicks when navigating menus. It&#8217;s probably cool for some games as well, although I haven&#8217;t purchased any from the apps store. If you have a Wii or a second generation Roku, you know what to expect. The remote is slightly more responsive than the Roku remote and the cursor moves a bit faster.Of course, if you don&#8217;t like using the cursor, you can use to the knob in the center kind of like a tiny track ball. You can press it to scroll, and you can move it side-to-side. There is a voice activation feature, but this is usually more trouble than it&#8217;s worth.The only downside to the remote is that it&#8217;s so unique that if you want to use a fancy universal remote with your TV, you lose some cool functionality. Thus, you&#8217;ll need to have at least two remotes for your AV system. It&#8217;s not a big deal to me - I don&#8217;t mind switching remotes - but it is to people like my parents who love their single remote system.Menus -The menu system on TVs varies greatly. The Samsung menus are pretty basic, but you have to click through a lot of submenus to get what you want. The Sony menus are a bit better, but not by much. The LG gives you a horizontal list that pops up anytime you hit the home button. My complaint here is that I would like to rearrange the menu items. I rarely watch things on Hulu, and yet it&#8217;s always my second option. It&#8217;s way more common that I watch a Blu-ray movie, but this means I have to move to a second screen to see the option. Other than that, I find the menu system to be very intuitive. Without reading the manual, I was able to navigate to any feature I wanted on the first try. As long as you have a typical amount of GUI intuition, you&#8217;ll find the menu system to be logical and user-friendly.Hardware/Software -My parents use a Sony system where everything runs through the Blu-ray player. It&#8217;s a nice, simple AV hub, but it feels a bit sluggish when compared to, say, a PC. It takes a few seconds for various things like Netflix to load, and it takes a bit of time to power on. The LG is surprisingly spritely. Startup takes maybe 10 seconds, but once the TV is going, the apps load quickly. Netflix pops right up, as does Hulu, YouTube, and whatever else you try.Interestingly, the LG keeps apps running in the background, which allows you to switch between video sources quickly. Say you&#8217;re watching Netflix, but you want to check out a YouTube video. Hit the home button, navigate to YouTube, return to the home menu, and Netflix appears in your recent apps section so that you can pick up right where you left off. This is way cooler than the Sony system where you have to completely exit Netflix to do anything else.Each app works a bit differently. The YouTube app is the worst by far because instead of giving you a grid of characters, you get a single row of letters. Searching takes forever. However, this is not, as some have claimed, LGs fault. Apparently, YouTube supplies electronics manufacturers with their own software. The LG YouTube interface is exactly the same as on my parents&#8217; Sony and my old Samsung. Fortunately, YouTube allows you to pair the TV with your smartphone or computer very easily, so you can bypass the apps annoying features entirely.3D -I think 3D is a gimmick. I don&#8217;t like paying extra for 3D in theaters, and I don&#8217;t care to pay extra for 3D blu-ray discs. Whatever. It&#8217;s my prejudice. The TV works just fine though. I don&#8217;t have enough bandwidth to stream 3D movies through Netflix (although it&#8217;s possible to do so), so my experience is limited to Blu-ray discs and HD broadcasts. Playing through Blu-ray looks amazing. The TV will simulate a 3D effect for HD broadcast input. I don&#8217;t get many stations over the air, but I did watch part of an episode of Ellen (it was all that was on the afternoon that I tried it), and it actually looked kind of decent. It&#8217;s not something I&#8217;d do every day, but it&#8217;s a fun gimmick to show friends. The glasses are just regular, 3D glasses like you&#8217;d wear at in a movie theater. No batteries required. You get two pairs, and extra pairs are kind of expensive. You could always just hold onto the 3D glasses you get next time you&#8217;re at the local multiplex.The only thing to keep in mind is that if you&#8217;re hoping to stream 3D movies through Netflix, you&#8217;ll need a lot of bandwidth. I pay for 5GB/sec from AT&T;, but realistically, they never give me more than 756k/sec, and that&#8217;s not enough. Make sure you are getting more like 1.5g/sec if you want to use this feature.Mirroring / Sharing / Pairing -Screen sharing is available via Miracast. I have Apple products, and they use Airplay. It&#8217;s not a huge deal because I can just connect through my AppleTV. If you have an Android device, you should have the functionality built in. I had a friend test it out, and he was able to connect very easily.Setup -Setup was a breeze, although it helps to have two people. Some TVs allow you to set up the base, which the monitor part slides onto. The LG involves screwing in two feet, so you kind of need someone to hold the monitor while driving the screws.Once you power it on, the software setup is fast, intuitive, and easy. An animated penguin character guides you through various steps. It&#8217;s mostly graphical, so you don&#8217;t have to read any obscure instructions or decode any jargon. It&#8217;s quite easy.Design -The appearance of the TV itself is difficult to comment on because with the incredibly narrow bezel, the frame virtually disappears. Essentially, it looks like a big plane of black glass until you turn it on. The minimal design works very well. It has taken me a little while to get used to the apparent lack of a bezel because I&#8217;m used to seeing the image framed by a black rectangle, while with the LG, the picture appears to go all the way to the edge, in a manner of speaking.Overall -Overall, I&#8217;m very pleased with the LG. It&#8217;s the nicest, best looking, most full-featured TV I&#8217;ve ever owned. At this point, I have no substantive complaints. Everything works as it is supposed to. Everything looks beautiful.

Charging a generic Android tablet, I can get 1.47 amps.  It doesn't matter if I'm using a charging port or not.  I'm not sure why the two 2.1 amp ports are marked as dedicated.

It's a good match for children or other basic users, or as a second device.  It's designed to be easy to setup, use and maintain.The hardware is limited but adequate for the uses above, and better than most other Chromebooks.  The upside of the hardware limitations is the long 8 hour battery life (as a laptop, or for displaying video about 6.5 hours).This is a newer model (the C720 series was introduced in fall 2013) with a number of improvements from the older C710 series, including longer battery life and smaller size.Other than being dinged for the bland design, it has gotten very positive reviews in late 2013 and early 2014.  Look for the Endgadget C720 review page for links to a number of reviews.  People like the trackpad.PORTABLE AND SMALL:  The compact size and light weight make it very portable.  However, the screen size and keyboard size may be too small for some users, depending on their hand size and their eyesight.  It's a 11.6\" HD Widescreen LCD display (1366 x 768 resolution) with a matte coating.  The keyboard is smaller and has less \"travel\" (up and down range of motion) than larger computers, but I found it easy to get used to and have no trouble typing on it.This laptop measures 11.3\" by 8\" x 0.8\" and weighs 2.76 pounds.CHROMEBOOK:  In case you don't know, a Chromebook is not a Windows or Mac computer.  It's based on the Google Chrome suite, and the operating system is Chrome OS.  This works fine if *all* the applications you need are on the web.  But note that it will not run Skype (a Microsoft product), or let you install any other software (including drivers for mice or printers).  So printing is somewhat cumbersome (depending on your setup) and not all USB drives and devices will work.However, the Chrome OS and Chromebooks have some substantial advantages, besides the price:  you don't have to buy any software or hardware; you don't have mess around with Windows for software updates, dealing with problems, etc.; virus protection is built in; and if you have issues with software you can easily re-load all the software with a \"PowerWash.\"FAST BOOT:  Because this uses Chrome OS and a Solid State Drive, it boots very quickly - less than 10 seconds usually.ACER:  Acer is the fourth largest computer company in the world, after Lenovo, HP and Dell, and ahead of Asus.  They also sell computers under the Gateway and Packard Bell brand names.REFURBISHED:  Computers sold as refurbished aren't new.  Sometimes they've been repaired, sometimes they are just returns.  Some may have cosmetic damage - but they should not have any functional issues. You do need to be prepared to return the item if there's a problem, so it may not be for everyone.  But for most people, it's a way to get a great value on a laptop that will work as well as a new one.  You'll forget it's refurbished.90 DAY WARRANTY:  As a refurbished computer, the warranty is only 90 days.  Typically problems appear early on, and there aren't many moving parts in this computer.  But the shorter coverage is one reason why this costs less.2GB OF RAM, MAXIMUM:  The maximum amount of memory that can be installed is the 2 GB that this ships with.  That's enough for most web applications, but not enough for intensive applications like complex photo or video editing.  It is fairly fast PC3-12800 DDR3 memory, though.MODEST PROCESSOR: The Intel Celeron 2955U dual-core processor runs at 1.4GHz and has a CPU benchmark score of 1533.  It's fine for the uses described above, but only comparable in processing power to the netbooks that were so popular a few years ago.  However, it is a newer processor (released Fall 2013), so the Intel HD graphics are improved and the newer Ultra Low Voltage processors extend the battery life.  It's also a more capable processor than some other Chromebooks, which use tablet-quality processors.LIMITED STORAGE SO USE THE CLOUD: The 16GB solid state drive won't hold many files; about 10GB of the space is free for your files.  So plan on using the cloud and/or flash drives for your storage needs.  There is a built in SD card reader as well.USB 3.0: You may not think this matters to you, but it does.  If you want to use flash drives, external hard drives or a memory card reader, USB 3.0 is far faster than USB 2.0. There's one USB 3.0 port and one USB 2.0 port on this laptop.SOME NICE FEATURES:  The C720-2802 includes the essential features -  wifi, stereo speakers, a basic webcam - as well as as well as some nice features not found on all low price computers - Bluetooth 4.0 for wireless connections to a phone or speakers; and  HDMI to connect video devices, displays or a TV.  However, as with all of these tiny laptops, there is no optical drive (DVD).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great value for money for basic web-based uses", "unixReviewTime": 1395360000, "reviewTime": "03 21, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "AG08CH0JOV7SK", "asin": "B00IJD3QTC", "reviewerName": "Stephen Huang", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "I bought 3 units because of the price, performance and weight of this Chromebook.

Once I had done this, the adapter worked with both Macs and Windows computers. the performance with Macs was very smooth and fast. I am leaving the original review below.*** The original review. ***The main laptop that I use is a MacBook Air. It is a really great device, very portable, well engineered, and very fast for the purposes of the main tasks I use it for - word processing, email, web surfing, some light photo and video editing. However, its lightness and portability come at a price - MacBook Air is extremely ports-deficient. It has only two USB ports, one SD card slot and a small headphones jack. Most of the times when I use it none of this lack of ports bothers me, but there are situations when I need to use more than two USB devices at the same time, or connect to the Internet via a wired connection. This small Inateck USB/Ethernet hub seemed like an ideal accessory to have around. Unfortunately, I couldn't get ethernet working.I am running Mac OS-X Mavericks on all of my computers. I've connected bot my MacBook Air and Mac Mini to this adapter, but neither one of them was able to recognize the ethernet connection. (The USB hub part was fine.) The adapter comes with no printed instructions, and the pdf manual is very sparse and very clearly geared to Windows computers.In order to see if I didn't by any chance get a defective unit, I connected this adapter to my Windows 8 machine. The adapter was recognized immediately without any need for the installation of the driver software. The Ethernet connection was extremely smooth and fast, and I didn't see any difference as compared to getting online through the dedicated Ethernet port.The three USB 3.0 ports have functioned splendidly, both on my Mac and Windows computers. They really help with the additional connectivity, without the need for external power. The USB strip is fairly compact, so you would not want to connect any bulkier USB devices to it.This could have been a really great overall adapter, but unfortunately right now I cannot recommend it to any Mac users out there. The users of Windows ultrabooks, on the other hand, should really appreciate all the additional connectivity that this adapter offers.**** Product provided for review purposes. ****", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Update: Works with Macs and Windows Computers", "unixReviewTime": 1397779200, "reviewTime": "04 18, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "AT28RL25Q2OLK", "asin": "B00IJU0K2Q", "reviewerName": "NyReckDiver", "helpful": [7, 7], "reviewText": "I tested this product in a Windows 7 environment and was extremely impressed.

This did the trick and did it quickly and effectively.I opted to use this as a repeater versus an access point. You have both options. I needed it to extend my signal to a room that was getting a very marginal one according to theWi-Fi Analyzerapp I used to measure it.Before installing this range extender I was getting a signal of about -45 dBm near the primary wireless router and -80 dBm in the dead room. After installing this extender the signal boosted to -50 dBm in that room, which was a dramatic improvement and also eliminated the unstable WiFi connection messages I was getting on my smartphone when I was in that room.Installation is exceptionally easy if you follow the very clearly written and illustrated instruction manual that comes this this device. You need to select whether you want to use this as a repeater of access point. Either mode will work and I tried both. You can configure this from your browser, so no additional software or drivers are required.Some aspects of the installation and configuration are technical, but even a non-technical person can perform the necessary steps if the instructions are followed to the letter. What impressed me was the instruction manual had a card enclosed with a support number in Los Angeles, a support web site and email address. I did not use the email to test response, but the support site had a downloaded app for Macs and Windows that will assist the staff in analyzing problems. That level of support speaks volumes about the quality of the overall operation.Performance exceeded my expectations, especially considering the less than twenty-bucks this cost at the time or this review.

Sabrent's unit is one of the most easily installed appliances that I've evaluated. (I received a review sample from the company.)Other repeaters that I've tested required a wired connection to a laptop or desktop for initial setup. That's a bit of a nuisance and requires at least some networking knowledge. But this unit can be configured over the air. I tried that, using the instruction booklet supplied with the device, and had it set up in just a couple of minutes. It really can't get any better than that.The unit's box, and the web advertising, don't point out that this unit will also operate as a wireless access point, a wireless router, or a &#34;wisp&#34; router (if you use a wireless internet service provider). While the instruction booklet does well enough showing you how to enable it as a repeater, the access point instructions aren't so good, being not very complete and containing errors. The other modes aren't described at all. However, if you do have some networking skills, it's not hard to figure out. But the instructions could have been better, putting the unit more in the reach of the less technical user.How well does it work? Pretty well, actually. The repeated signal is strong enough to be quite useful. Positioning the unit is important. It is supposed to be halfway between the router and the target reception area, but I find it's better closer to the router. The unit wants a strong and stable input signal. It certainly puts out a strong output signal, so be sure your input is good and you'll get good performance.The unit plugs directly into a wall socket. This might put it near the floor when it would be better if it were higher up. For a permanent installation, you might rig something up to get more &#34;altitude&#34; for the unit. A higher location usually helps with both pick-up and transmission of the wireless signal. (Of course, if the router's on the first floor, the repeater's on the second, and the target is the third, you don't have to worry so much about this.) And by the way, when plugged in the unit restricts access to the second socket of a typical two-socket outlet. You can route a cord over the top ridge of the unit and into the outlet, but it's not convenient. The physical design of the unit could have been better.I wouldn't call this an especially portable unit, although it's lightweight. It's just a wee bit bulky and the outlet prongs don't fold. In any case, you'll probably put it in a fixed location.Bottom line: four stars for good performance and ease of setup.

I wanted a case that could hold the speaker in it's soft cover along with the AC adapter, bonus points if it could also hold the charging base.  I didn't want to spend $45 on the expensive Bose case so I purchased this one.This case holds the SoundLink Mini in it's soft cover though the fit is a little tight.  I took my speaker out of the soft cover and it fit better but I quickly put the soft cover back on.  The case also holds the AC adapter but not the charging dock.  That wasn't really a killer feature for me but it would have been nice.  The zipper is a little difficult to fully close with everything in the case but it still works.  All-in-all, the case does the job but it would have been nice to see some breathing room in there.  I like the semi-rigid design as, to me, it appears to offer more protection than a standard soft case.  For this price, I really don't think you can go wrong as it's $20 less than the one from Bose yet holds the same content.My only big complaint is that this case smells awful.  It has a processed plastic smell that takes a while to air out.  I highly suggest immediately taking it out of the plastic wrapping, opening it, and putting the case outside overnight.  Then bring it back in, stuff it with some dryer sheets, zip the case up, and let it sit for a few more days.  I have had mine for almost a week now and the smell is just now coming out.Edit:I am updating my review after three weeks of ownership.  I could never get the smell fully out of the case.  It was so bad that it spread to the soft cover of the SoundLink Mini making that smell too.  I've tried everything, including Febreeze on the inside, but the case still smelled.  It wasn't near as bad as when I first opened the case but it was still pretty bad.  The zipper also broke just after 3 weeks of ownership.  I took it on one trip, the zipper busted open, and I could never really get it back.  The case is just a hair too small to hold the speaker in a cover and AC charger (even though it has a pouch for the charger).I recommend people save up their money and buy a more expensive option even if it is the $45 Bose case.  It's better than this $20-ish case and won't break after a few weeks, plus it doesn't smell like processed chemicals.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "It does the job, barely", "unixReviewTime": 1399248000, "reviewTime": "05 5, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A27BM0NE02FMK5", "asin": "B00IKDETOC", "reviewerName": "Kikkiaro", "helpful": [9, 9], "reviewText": "I replaced a lower wattage Seasonic unit with this.

The 850G2 is a great looking unit with its unique fan grill and textured finish, and feels quite substantial. Cables are just ok though, with ribbon cables sleeved quite lazily with quite a bit of of the heat shrink showing. It would have been better to leave the black ribbon cables bare. The connectors are good and plentiful though; much better than my last XFX units.The power supply is quiet even when not in the hybrid fan mode. I would recommend just leaving the fan on all of the time to avoid reducing the lifespan of the unit. It does come with a 10 year warranty though, so this may not concern you. It is running smoothly and is stable at full loads on an overclocked i5 high end rig with crossfired 7950's. All of my components are pushed to the max overclock not including memory and this thing still runs pretty quiet.

I want to add that I also purchased the premium cables they offer on their website, and they arrived quickly. The cables are much better than what come with the unit, so I am left with the feeling that they skimped on the stock ones with the hopes of luring you to the premium cables (which come in at 90$).

Also, a lot of the info was provided to describe it's features and accessory content to give you an overview of the product even before you take it out of the box. Once out of the box, you can't help but notice the quality of the material crafted with premium metal finish covering the back of earbuds and in-line remote while still weighting only 19g. One thing that stood out for me was a relatively slim profile of the earbuds body which doesn't stick out too much outside of your ear. The flat rubberized wire was attached to earbuds with a very secure strain relief, which is longer on the left side perhaps due to additional wiring in lieu of the charging port. The in-line remote is on the right side, closer to the right earbud and has a distinct profile with a recessed space for multi-function button in the middle which is very easy to find between volume/track up/down controls. In addition to that, in-line remote also hosts NFC zone for an easy pair up with your smartphone or tablet device supporting it. The overall construction is very durable and actually IP52 certified which suggests protection against dust and water. The ROX is build solid and would be a perfect companies for any indoor or outdoor activities.In addition to earbuds, Jabra also included a very generous amount of accessories. You get a premium quality usb to micro-usb charging cable (yes, no need for any proprietary connectors, it uses a standard micro-usb port under the magnetic cover of left earbud), a protective drawstring storage pouch, a removable FitClip which can adjust the length of the cable in the back, a set of 3 pairs of EarWing stabilizers for ultra-secure fit in your ear (these are among the best I have tried with any wired or wireless sports headphones), a quick start guide, and 4 pairs of premium EarGel eartips, including one double-flange pair. I'm talking about hybrid type with a ColorCore rather than some cheap generic silicone tips. That right away triggered a thought: Jabra mean serious business about the sound quality. As you well aware, I review a lot of premium in-ear headphones, and any company which includes quality eartips is serious about their sound quality. Unfortunately, for my own personal fitment I had to use my own eartips (another set of large hybrid eartips), but I have to bring to everyones attention - the selection of eartips for the best fitment with ROX earbuds is VERY important. You have to treat it like any premium wired headphones, also considering these headphone have a short in-ear stem thus you want to seal your ear canal for the best sound isolation no matter how secure EarWings will hold them in your ear.Once you get the best seal - hold on to your seat because you will get hit with a deep bass that will make your jaw drop. By default, they are tuned to produce a strong thick v-shaped fun sound dominated by bass and roll off in upper mids/treble. Now here comes the beauty. Remember I said early on that once your headset receives a compressed sound, it's impossible to correct it because of the missing audio content? Here, using my Note 2 and a stock audio player I was able to select &#34;Classic&#34; EQ preset (which tunes down mid-bass hump and tunes upper mids/treble to brighten the sound with more clarity and overall balance) and I couldn't believe my ears I was listening to a music through a wireless connection. Yeah, it was that good, thanks to BT 4.0 and dedicated DSP sound processing. I'm not hyping it up, it just needs a selection of the right size eartips and some EQ tweaking, unless you prefer the default sound signature. The in-line remote worked perfectly to play/pause/call and volume controls were adjusting the level up/down as well as skipping tracks next/prev. Though sound quality while listening to the music or watching movies, etc. was fantastic, during making the calls the people on the other end heard me really good while on my end a experience a little tunnel sound. It was still acceptable, but not the best. Furthermore, I tested wireless connection to work up to 40 ft in the open area.Battery life always a sore subject when it comes to wireless headsets.  ROX actually occupies a happy medium with 6 hours of music streaming and 5.5 hours of talk time. As I mentioned before, charging port is a common micro-usb connector so you can charge ROX from your laptop or wall charger or car charger used for any of your smartphones or tablets. The standby time is very impressive 18 days. Now to take it to the next level, Jabra introduced a clever power-saving functionality which gets activated once you attach earbuds back-to-back using it's built-in magnets. That actually serves a dual purpose since when not in use, you turn your headset into a secure necklace preventing ROX from slipping down, and at the same time going into power-saving sleep mode disconnecting from your phone. Once you disengage the magnets, it pairs up back instantaneously with your phone. I also found when ROX is unpaired, you can simply attach earbuds magnetically to each other and take them apart to pair up with a phone. I was very impressed with this original functionality. Also, Jabra talks a lot about Dolby Digital Plus implementation which can be activated by downloading their free app. I found this app to be a substitute to a stock media player with different EQ setting, and ability to enable Dolby Digital surround sound which actually added an artificial depth to a sound - not my cup of tea.In a brief summary I would like to explain why I found ROX to be superior to BlueBuds X (BBX) and BackBeat Go 2 (BBG2). First of all, ROX has the most &#34;regular&#34; in-ear fitment without sticking out too much out of your ears. Of course, these are not a tiny earbuds considering how much electronics they host, but they were on-par with some multi-driver premium IEM wired headphones I tested in the past. In comparison, BBX and BBG2 were sticking out too much, and BBG2 stabilizers were useless. Also, the sound quality was by far superior due to a full body detailed warm sound (comparing apple-to-apples with a same Classic EQ setting and the best eartip fitment) and great low end with deep sub-bass and a fast punch of mid-bass. BBX sound is more bloated and BBG2 is on a thin side in comparison to ROX. One thing I found with ROX that was inferior to others, the in-line remote was too close to the right earbud and as a result on a few occasions while reaching out to control playback or volume I actually pulled the earbud out of my ear.Overall, I was VERY pleased with a design, build, and performance of ROX wireless earbuds. Everything from high quality material, to a rugged performance backed by IP52 certification, ability to pair up via Bluetooth or using NFC, magnetic stand-by mode which also allows to securely keep earbuds around your neck, a decent battery like and the MOST important - a truly massive sound quality, elevated these wireless headphones to the top of my list in comparison to other headphones in this category. Though priced a bit on a high side, they are still comparable to BBX and not too far away from BBG2, while having an advantage in both design and performance in comparison to either of those.

I have a D800e and, at the time, had the D610. I sold the D610 in order to help the cost of the D4S and I'm sooooooo glad that I did. The D800e is an awesome camera that can hold its own, but when compared to the D4S, it feels like a toy. For one, the fact the D800e really only shoots well up to ISO 6400 feels &#34;limiting&#34; now that the D4S shoots up to ISO 16,000 comfortably. I sort of miss the megapixels going down from 36 to 16 (for cropping), but the far far superior quality of the photos from the D4S wipes that away. It also forces me to get a little better at composition in-camera.In landscape mode, the grip and feel of the D4S is awesome. Meaty and great to feel. In portrait mode, the grip, for me, doesn't feel as good as the D800e with the Nikon grip (MB-D12). I don't have huge or small hands...just medium hands. The MB-D12 has more of a squared off feel and it really fits into my hand well. The portrait grip on the D4S feels a little thin to me. I don't feel like it'll fall out of my hands but this thinner grip doesn't just fall into my hands like the MB-D12. As a result, I need to take a second to search for the shutter button. It's not a dealbreaker but I know they redesigned the ergonomics and this is one area I found to be different.The 11fps is freakin AWESOME!!!!!! I'm a prosumer so I do formal weddings, portraits, some sports, pets, etc. but even as a &#34;regular&#34; user, the 11fps is great. We have a Great Dane and the burst mode comes in very handy when we're playing with her. It just goes and goes and goes. The group autofocus is also great. I always use single point focus on my D800e but I'm a group autofocus guy on the D4S. Still center-based but having the slightly larger AF area is really nice. Great feature. My parents had their 50th anniversary recently and they did a cake cutting like in a wedding. I had my SB-910 speedlight and SD-9 battery pack in place while shooting in continuos high mode. I was able to rapid fire and catch the entire sequence which lasted about 12 seconds. All shot in 14-bit RAW and the camera didn't stutter at all. Group autofocus caught everything in focus!Finally, I'll list just a few other items that I find useful instead of replicating all of the reviews online.Backlighting: big feature for me! It's a cool teal/blue color but I've shot timelapse sequences at night with the D4S and the backlighting has been great.Small display on the back: before I had the D4S, I didn't think it was useful. It IS useful. All of your information is right there.Battery door: this has a push button release that flings the door open as opposed to the manually sliding door on the D800e. It feels better and of higher quality.Memory Cards: The D4S uses XQD and CF cards. Does it suck that the XQD costs a lot more? Sure. But this is a pro camera and it is FAST. In the end, it's worth it. I usually shoot with the camera writing to both cards and when I import photos into Lightroom, I always use the XQD card as my reference.No built-in flash: I have two SB-910 speedlights and one SB-700 speedlight. On my D800e I usually use the pop-up flash to wirelessly trigger my speedlights so it's a little bit of a bummer that the D4S doesn't have the built-in flash for convenience. However. I'm fortunate to have 3 flashes so I can &#34;waste&#34; one for triggering the other two flashes. I have PocketWizards (MiniTT and FlexTT5 models) but they aren't currently compatible with the D4S (although a new PocketWizard beta software is on the way)Built-in viewfinder door: this is a really nice feature. A built-in door to close light off from the viewfinder. It can also protect the viewfinder window and keep dust out.Overall, this is a wonderful camera and, sadly, my D800e hasn't been used much since I got the D4S. Instill need a 2nd body the D4s is simply a joy to use and makes photography so much fun. It's the camera that has all capabilities in the world so I feel like I can do anything with it and not be limited. If you're on the fence about the D4S, don't be. Just get it because you won't be disappointed. And Amazon offers 30-day returns! Give it a shot!!Final thought...there are many opinions out there as the D4S being not worth the upgrade. Sure, if you have a D4, the D4S is probably not worth the upgrade. Just like the new D810 that was just announced. I have the D800e and the D810 is absolutely not worth the upgrade.

To be sure, the D4 wasn't weak in either of these areas, but shooting in low light, with critters that like to move, or in good light with a lot of lens and often teleconverters, the D4s is just a great camera. After using AF Fine Tune to finesse my long primes and the combos using teleconverters, the D4s is the first camera I grab for, most of the time, depending on the light and how much magnification I need for the desired composition. I didn't need 11 fps compared to the 10fps of the D4, but with BIF, it may be helpful for getting that exactly optimum wing position, so I'll be glad to tap into it.

It immediately showed me it was charging at 2.1 amps / 5 volts. It took about 4 hours to exhaust the battery pack and the charge on the Ipad mini showed 85%. More than satisfactory, more than I expected. So there are four things I like most about this device: 1. The Display 2. The  fit and finish 3. Charging Capacity and 4. Charging Speed. To sum up, I love this Maxboost Electron Mini. It's the perfect mate for my Ipad Mini. If you're looking to get yourself something you'll use and enjoy this is it. Also would make a great birthday or Christmas gift. I definitely won't be leaving home without it.

Just screw in the antennae, plug it in, put the batteries in the remote and you're good.The picture is great. It isn't a &#34;smart&#34; tv put it is still pretty smart.

It'd be great to bring with you on the road.However, last night it became stuck in a boot loop where it would load, freeze, and then reboot repeatedly. I believe the device has an overheating issue since it gets hot after being being on for 5-10 minutes through USB (when the TV is on) or the wall. Both make me wonder how it would be 6 months from now if this is only after 3 days. It is also relatively slow, but not to the point of killing the device given how portable it is and it is Roku's first generation of the product.They need a second generation device to fix these issues where they can work out the speed/heat issues and I think it'd be a good device, but until then seeing the letters \"R-O-K-U\" dance (the boot screen) is not the entertainment I was looking for.

My girls don't miss at all because virtually everything they desire to watch (or hear) can be accessed with a few key components for a one-time total cost equal to 1-2 months of cable service.Here's what I've done, noting there are countless ways (technologies) that can be combined to achieve the same or similar results. Final configuration will always come down to personal preference. Here is mine as it is for now, with the most important first:1) Flat Screen TV: but the best you can afford because it is the one item of them all you will be using the most. For our master bedroom set-up we have a Sony Bravia Sony KDL-40R450A ($499, but this will not be factored into the cost since it's assumed you already have a TV, if not this one represents great cost-quality value.)http://www.amazon.com/Sony-KDL-40R450A-40-Inch-1080p-Black/dp/B00AWKBZQQ/2) DVD Player w/ Internet: Sony BDP-BX110/S1100 Blu-ray Player - $77.00http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BQ3EGPU/The extra-short response time, coupled with HD upscaling and Internet connection make this a wonderful choice for the price. The Internet connection gives you access to a large number of content providers found on Roku, Apple TV and Amazon Fire TV. Those on a shoestring budget can get away with this single item if you are not too picky about missing the benefits provided by these other options.3) Roku 3500R Streaming Stick - $49http://www.amazon.com/Roku-3500R-Streaming-Stick-HDMI/dp/B00INNP5VU/As much as I adore my Amazon Fire TV, I'd be lying if I put it before Roku. The main reason is its vast channel offering. Period. Ultimately out of the thousands of channels offered on Roku, I have settled for only about 50, but they have added immensely to the pleasure I derive from the content accessible. I love that all of my Spotify Playlists are accessible and which I love getting lost in through the excellent speakers on the Sony as well as the TDK SoundCube, which is a non-essential add on that has taken the overall audio experience to a higher level. There are movie channels (both free and pay), but since I can pay only for the exact ones I wish to see, if they're not available on Amazon Prime, Apple TV or Netflix, there's no reason to pay for a monthly service. I have taken Qello up on their free offer as I love live concert movies. If it's actually worth the $5 per month, time will tell. There is no doubt that anyone serious about Cutting the Cord, would be well served by a Roku.4) HDTV Antenna: AmazonBasics Extreme Performance Ultra Thin Amplified Indoor HDTV Antenna - $58http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DIFIP06/This ultra-thin antenna allows you to pick all of the free HDTV over-the-air channels broadcasting in your area. We have access to scores of channels, but when I whittled them down to the ones that we would actually want to see, we ended with about 15, including, ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, PBS and others. It really boils down to spending a few dollars to ensure HD reception of the major networks, which is a definite must-have and well worth the cost.5) Amazon Fire TV - $99http://www.amazon.com/Amazon-CL1130-Fire-TV/dp/B00CX5P8FC/A wonderful product. Amazing. However, ultimately it is a nice-to-have...a luxury. That said, I LOVE this product and am grateful that something inside me was compelled to get one. So what is it about Fire TV that moves me so much? There are only a few, but they are powerful persuaders:&#62; Voice Search works PERFECTLY and allows you to say a word, name, genre, title, director. Anything. In return you easily find what you're looking for.&#62; Amazon Instant Video and Netflix are delivered, accessed and resumed perfectly. The picture is immaculate. The quality, undeniable. It is just such a joy for these two reasons that unless you have used it, it's virtually impossible to convey the exquisite usability of Fire TV.The only downside at this point in time with respect to Amazon Fire TV is that it has few content providers on board as compared to Roku or even Apple TV, but this is changing as Amazon is in the process of adding content apps and seems committed to continue to do so into the future.6) Apple TV - $93http://www.amazon.com/Apple-MD199LL-A-TV/dp/B007I5JT4S/The only reason and yet the best reason we have an Apple TV is that we're an Apple family and it makes zero sense NOT to own an Apple TV. It's just the way it is if you are committed to Apple, as it also has a highly intuitive and polished user interface as well as a number of desirable content providers. Apple TV remains the easiest way to share and access your Apple content across the members of your family.7) Google Chromecast - $35http://www.amazon.com/Google-Chromecast-Streaming-Media-Player/dp/B00DR0PDNE/This HDMI stick simply and easily allows you to &#34;cast&#34; ANY and ALL internet content from any PC or Mac that is running the free Chrome browser onto any TV with a HDMI connection. Think about that for a moment. Anything you can access on the Web, you can view on your TV. YouTube viewing through the Chrome browser has been optimized for Chromecast and is a far, far better YouTube viewing experience than watching them any other way. All for $35. Talk about value!8) Rabbit TV - $8http://www.amazon.com/Telebrands-Rabbit-TV/dp/B00AWC51DW/One can only be disappointed by this small and powerful little USB stick if they have not properly managed their expectations. Coupled with Chromecast, Rabbit TV is in essence a meta-search filter to access thousands of Internet content providers, representing a gargantuan amount of audio and video at one's fingertips. When you put it in perspective, $10 to effectively and efficiently search for anything you can think of, is a major advantage. Despite being at the bottom of the list, Rabbit TV is a must-have by any measure!The final optional item that may be necessary in order to hook all of these HDMI cable into your TV is a Fosmon HD1831 3-Port HDMI Switch - $13http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008GVOVK0/This allows one to expand a single HDMI port into three and it works perfectly.CONCLUSION:The bottom line is that for around $400, one can feel good about Cutting the Cord to your cable or satellite company. You get access to virtually any programming you wish to consume, albeit some you might have to pay for either through a service like Netflix, Amazon Prime or pay-per-view/rental. When one looks at the cost vs. cable fees it does not take long to realize that it makes a lot of sense to save the money and enjoy your shows and movies just as much for a tiny fraction of the cost.There are always disappointment when one finds a compromise and no doubt you will too, as I did with ESPN which one can't receive unless through cable or satellite, but in the end it is still a small price to pay as far as I'm concerned. One thing is for certain, it is possible to say goodbye to cable fees and not look back!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A Key Piece to \"Cutting the Cord\" to Monthly Cable Bills!", "unixReviewTime": 1401062400, "reviewTime": "05 26, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A3T9HNU52G8Y4Z", "asin": "B00INNP5VU", "reviewerName": "Don", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "Roku, in my opinion, is the best streaming media device on the market and at a great price.

Gets power from a USB plug, which on our TV is located right next to the HDMI port. Use a six-inch Micro USB cable and you can plug this thing in and not even have to see it, with no messy wires, etc.2.) It's easy to set up. I was connected to our network within a couple of minutes. I could connect it to most networks even faster, but ours doesn't broadcast the SSID so I had to type it in manually.3.) It's easy to connect to online accounts.

I have an LG blu-ray player that also plays some of the same apps that the Roku does, and the Chromecast can 'cast.  So, with that in mind, my review takes into account my usage of all three.The LG is a few years old by this point, and the three apps I tend to use on it are Hulu, Amazon, and Netflix.  It's been my go-to for watching movies and series, but of course, the biggest problem was A: I had to turn it on, wait for everything to load (at least two menus worth before even loading an app), and then slowly work my way through said apps. Chromecast, on the other hand, was a bit of a slow load at the beginning, but for the apps it worked with, they loaded fairly fast.But the Roku is somewhere in-between.  And that's not bad.  There are other reviews that complain about how long it takes to load some things, but really, these are First World Problems in a nutshell: once everything gets going, there's no real loading problems unless your internet or router is having a fit.  If your TV doesn't turn off the power to the dongle, or you plug directly into an outlet, the Roku doesn't take the time to load everytime you switch to it to watch something; if you do use the USB and it turns off, your loading time is perhaps 40 seconds at most, at least in my experience.  So what?  I'm in no rush.  And again, if the loading time bugs you, you can plug it into the wall, and it won't turn off.Once the Roku is on, it's like a slimmer, faster version of my LG.  I can use the remote or my phone to navigate; it's not like the Chromecast which requires you to be on the same wireless network to 'cast the app you want to play.  If you didn't have a smartphone or a tablet, the Roku still works, whereas the Chromecast is basically useless.  (Yes, you can pull out a computer, but since that's buggy and requires the Chrome browser as well, what's the point?)  Some apps do load slowly, most notably Netflix, but again, I'm in no hurry to go anywhere, and I've been long used to a different player taking even longer to load.  But again, once it's loaded, they're ready to go.  Really, the only reason the Chromecast can load faster is that the dongle itself is basically just a mini-router; there's really nothing loaded on it before you send the signal from your phone/tablet/computer.Unlike the Chromecast and the LG, the Roku is also customizable: visually, and content-wise.  Channels can be removed or added.  The background can be changed.  That's actually pretty nice, considering the Chromecast won't (yet) let you even change the start screen.  And the apps that work with it, while growing, do not include everything the Roku can play (most obviously Amazon).  Because the Roku has all three apps I was using on the LG, that makes it vastly more useful for me.And there's also the fact--however minor to some--that the Netflix and Hulu smartphone apps do not seem to work with the \"play next episode automatically\" feature when using the Chromecast, which is insanely annoying.  When using my tablet, I was constantly needing to lean over and press play after every episode.  Guess what?  The Roku has no problem with that feature.  That makes me extremely happy, even if Netflix insists on asking me every couple of episodes if I'm still watching.Overall, for an extra $15 over the Chromecast, the Roku is much more useful for me.  Maybe I'll spend the extra $50 later on for a Roku 3 and the faster processor, but for right now, this is working brilliantly. It's plugged in right below a router, so my signal is excellent, even though I do prefer ethernet.  Really, the only complaint I have is of my own make; I can't get 5.1 audio because I have no more ports open on my Pioneer receiver, and I have to plug it in to my TV straight.For me, this is definitely the better choice of streaming dongles.EDIT APRIL 9: So I've been using it pretty much daily since receiving it, and I have a few more things to add about my experience with the stick.First off, the remote does suck.  I mean, it really, really does suck.  Whoever designed it clearly has never seen another remote made in the last decade or so, because otherwise, they wouldn't have placed the OK button below the crossbar button.  Nor would they have forgotten to include A STOP BUTTON.  If you have the Roku plugged into the wall, using \"pause\" is the only way to basically stop whatever you're watching, or pressing the Home button to leave the app and go back to the main menu, before you turn off your TV.  If the Roku is plugged into the USB port, the stick itself turns off, and this is not such a big deal, but otherwise, you're basically constantly pausing things and letting them sit for hours (days?) paused until you decide to watch again.  That's a bit stupid considering.......this thing can get really warm.  It does seem to cool off when you're not actively watching anything, even if it's eternally paused, but it's definitely a hot body.  That worries me just a tad.Also, it sucks I can't replace the remote with my Harmony, but since that would require both IR and line of sight, the latter of which basically defeats the purpose of the dongle, I can see why it won't work.  The phone app is a decent substitute (and the keyboard makes it vastly easier to sign in [except Hulu for some reason, it refused to recognize the keyboard] and to search, instead of tapping each letter one by one), but I still wish I could use my universal remote.  The stock remote is basically nine buttons and four dedicated advertising slots, wasting what could have been actual useful space for MGo, Amazon, Netflix, and Blockbuster (seriously!?) logos.  Programmable buttons would have been better.  Supposedly the Roku 3's remote can be paired and used instead, but I haven't looked into it yet.Youtube's app has a nice feature where you can basically 'cast videos from your computer to watch, instead of having to use the app's search function.  Once you link it up, you can just go to Youtube on your computer, and send the video to your TV to watch.  Don't even need to keep the tab or window open on your computer once it starts playing, either.  It also doesn't require a specific browser like the Chromecast does.  I'm currently watching MSTK3's \"Manos: The Hands of Fate\" and considering the quality of Youtube in general, it actually looks and plays great.Really, the biggest problem I see with this stick is the remote.  It definitely needs to go back to the drawing board.

Granted, the Celeron will smash it in single threaded apps, but from what I can tell, the most important stuff is multi-threaded now.While the included fan is initially noisy on first boot, as long as you set up the SmartFan settings in the BIOS, you probably won't hear it again. While maxing-out the CPU on benchmark software, it never got hot enough to need even a third of the fan's maximum speed. The CPU itself is still somewhat pricey. Drop the price by $15 and it becomes a clear cut winner vs Intel in my opinion. Also, the heatsink mounting system was a bit of a hassle the first time through, but I managed to figure it out.AMD may have a really good thing going with this CPU. It seems to hit a nice sweet spot in efficiency between Intel's Bay Trail (which is non-socketed, and severely limits mainboard options), and the more power hungry Celerons.

Basically, if you&#8217;re out and about (on a long rail journey or away camping or at a rock festival), you can re-charge your phone up to 4 or 5 times back to full charge.What's it like?------------------In a word, beautiful.  Wrapped in a white hard case, and just slightly taller than a iPhone 5 or Nexus 5 (but a lot narrower and reassuringly heavy), it has a fantastic top quality feel about it.It comes in at 5.5 inches long by 2.5 inches wide and under half an inch deep.  Has a reassuring heft, and a lovely top quality finish with two USB ports (means you can charge two devices at the same time), and a single button which lights up 4 blue LED lights to indicate how fully charged it is.You&#8217;d be forgiven for mistaking this from a Apple designed product, as the quality and finish are top end.  Even the packaging, a custom designed box lined with a black inner case, and a white Micro-USB to USB cable and instructions inside.What will it charge?-------------------------Well, just about anything with a Mini or Micro USB or a cable with a full size USB plug - which is pretty standard on nearly all battery powered devices. A little research shows it's good for:-* Apple iPhone 5, 5s and 5c. (Using your own USB-Lightening connector)* Apple iPhone 3, 3G, 3Gs, 4, 4Gs. (Using your USB-30 pin cable)* Samsung Galaxy Note 3 S4 S3 S2 Note 2* Blackberry, HTC, LG, Motorola, Sony android Smart Phones and Tablets.* Google Nexus 4 and 5 smartphones and Nexus 7 and 10 tablet computers* Kindle Paperwhite Fire HD, GPS and just about anything else with a USB connector.Does it work?------------------Glad to say, yes. it charged my Google Nexus 5 from absolutely flat to 100% in under 2 and a half hours.  What&#8217;s more, the 4 lights (which each indicate 25% charge) didn&#8217;t even move, and I&#8217;d expect it&#8217;ll charge another 3 to 4 times before fully flat.The battery is rated at 10,400mAh (the higher the better) which means it should charge a smartphone several times before finally needing to be plugged in.For example, here's the battery capacity (mAh) of some popular smartphones:-* Google Nexus 5 - 2,300* Samsung Galaxy S3 - 2,100* Samsung Galaxy S4 - 2,600* Apple iPhone 5 - 1,400* Apple iPhone 5S - 1,570* Apple iPhone 4S - 1,432So (roughly speaking), you should get around 4 to 5 full charges out of an iPhone 5 before you need to re-charge the unit.What's Good about it?-----------------------------* Absolutely top quality build and packagingSolid and sturdy with a nice heft.Comes with a felt draw-string bag and USB to Micro USB cable* Enough power to charge a standard smartphone 4+ times.What's not so good?---------------------------Not a lot really.  You need to use your existing charger to power it up, but it comes 100% fully charged straight from the box, and if it came with another charger, it&#8217;s just yet another charger to lose.Conclusion---------------Fantastic little charger.

Their small size means that there is hardly any room for sound to propagate so bass tends to be weaker. Because they are in the ear rather than over it, that &#34;the music seems to be located in my head rather than in a real space&#34; feeling is a common complaint. I am not much of an IEM listener, favoring over-the-ear headphones for their superior characteristics but I am always on the look-out for a superior IEM.I spent several hours listening to the new Denon AH-C120MA in-ears: playing all kinds of music and experimenting with different sizes and composition of ear-tips. I switched portable devices between Apple made iPods and iPads, an iBasso DX90 DAP and an Amazon Kindle Fire HDX 8.9&#34;. My impression of the Denon AH-C120MA In-Ear was generally quite good.Switching between ear-tips, I finally settled on the pair of medium sized Comply foam TX-400M ear tips included in the box. I found them more comfortable than the three pairs of silicon ear tips that were included, considerably less rigid and with a slightly brighter sound. A good seal is imperative when listening to IEMs so I moistened the ear tips slightly before insertion. This seems to create a firmer bond and the addition of evaporating water vapor allows more molecules to be set into motion in the ear canal, which seems to enhance the bass and lower mid-range.The AH-C120MA in-ears have an exceptionally wide sound stage. They are successful at eliminating that &#34;in my head&#34; sound because they create a real sense of acoustic space. The soundstage has a real illusion of width which I found impressive. This is coupled with a nice transparency and an exceptionally pleasant brightness in the music. There wasn't the slightest sense of fatigue after an hour or two of listening. Instrumental music benefits from this spacious presentation, though the mid-range was sufficiently forward to showcase vocals to good advantage as well.Where I found these slightly deficient - as expected - was in the lower-mids and bass. You know they're present but they lack the thump or slam of over-the-ear headphones. Since my listening tastes run mostly to Classical and Jazz, I was not particularly perturbed by this. If your tastes run mostly to hard rock, metal or hip-hop you probably put a premium on bass slam so you should be aware of these intrinsic limitations. Nevertheless, because of their impressive spaciousness, transparency and life-like sound, I thought these in-ear headphones a good value and a solid replacement for generic IEMs.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "An exceptionally wide sound stage and nice musical transparency highlight these IEMs", "unixReviewTime": 1405728000, "reviewTime": "07 19, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A22KGO6Q2YWS0C", "asin": "B00IQ0SDVY", "reviewerName": "Dean!", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "I had to look up what made this model any different than the previous one and the only major difference I can see is the 4k 60hz support!

New this year is the addition of support for HDMI specified 4K/60 Hz video.Out of the box, the TX-NR535 is noticeably well built. It's a clean design, and all the inputs/outputs are well laid out. For testing, I replaced my already setup Denon AVR-E300 with the TX-NR535. I'm using the Klipsch HD300 Speaker System. Getting setup was quick and painless. The menu system on the TX-NR535 is pretty basic and easy to navigate. The GUI looks like something form the 80's, but it's not a big deal. I chose the settings for my speakers manually, and did not use the \"AccuEQ Room Calibration\". I found a minor issue setting up a Verizon FiOS 4 device remote. There is no code for turning the receiver both on and off. One code will work for turning it on, and another will turn it off. I did a quick Google search and found that this seems to be an issue with many Onkyo receivers. It's not a big deal to me though. The TX-NR535 has built-in WiFi and BT support, which is great. My Denon  AVR-E300 required a wireless adapter. Once connected to my network, I had access to my Sirius/XM account, along with several other music services. I was able to listen to music stored on my PC via DLNA streaming. There is one thing that the TX-NR535 doesn't have which to me is a disappointment. It is built-in Apple \"AirPlay\" support. I store my entire music library on my iPods, and I love using AirPlay to connect them to my system. My Denon AVR-E300 Receiver which is older and costs about half of what the TX-NR535 costs, has AirPlay built-in. There is an Onkyo iPad/iPod app which allows connecting and streaming from your Apple device. It is a little slow and buggy, but it does work. There is a similar app for Android too. My other minor disappointment is that the TX-NR535 doesn't have a built-in graphic equalizer. All you have are basic tone controls, \"optimization\", and bass boosting options.Once everything was hooked up and tested, I got down to listening to some music. Overall I was pretty impressed. Despite not being able to tailor the sound with an equalizer, everything I listened to sounded great. I started by watching Led Zeppelin's \"Celebration Day\" Blu-ray. I was impressed by the highs and lows. I then listened to some New Age music by Kitaro, and some EDM by Deadmau5. I can't complain about anything I heard, and I missed the equalizer much less than I expected. All in all, I'm very happy with the Onkyo TX-NR535. I'm disappointed that some features are missing, but it's still a high quality A/V receiver for the price.Pros:Well designed and built.Easy to setup.Built-in WiFi and BT.Built-in Internet Radio, Sirius/XM, and Streaming.Nice sound.UltraHD 4K/60Hz support.Good value.Plenty of HDMI Inputs.Cons:5 channel instead of 7 channel.No built-in AirPlay support.No built-in graphic equalizer.Archaic GUI.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good 5.2 Channel A/V Receiver.", "unixReviewTime": 1395792000, "reviewTime": "03 26, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A1LAGS8H4A2DR7", "asin": "B00IQ0SE22", "reviewerName": "Bill Nicholas", "helpful": [6, 7], "reviewText": "This is the 4th Network AV receiver I've used the last 4 years. This is also the highest specs/most featured one. Previously I was using a Denon AVR-X100, before that an Onkyo TX-NR515 and before that a Harman Kardon AVR 2600.Pros:1) 7.2 ability - I believe my Harman Kardon had 7.1, but I didn't have the speakers for it. Now I do and I love 7.2 sound. My set up uses 2 high and wide speakers up front. For movies and shows created to use 7.1, the effect is epic. I wasn't sure if it would make a difference, but it did and it's nice to have. The \".2\" means you can add 2 subwoofers, which I'm beginning to really get curious about......2) Easy set up and network connectivity - This is something that has been improving with each new receiver. Lately it seems like I just have to connect to the network and everything just shows up. I think DNLA enabled devices are the easiest to use. It just seems like everything that can be used is easily found with no extra tinkering. Wireless and bluetooth work fine, too3) Good internet streaming source list - Good list and includes Slacker, my favorite. The Denon had the fewest choices4) Auto speaker set up software - This is something my last 2 receivers had and I really like it. You use an included microphone to get the best sound adjustments. This model of Onkyo uses their own version of software but it is unclear if it is a version of Audyessy. While I like it, read on in the Cons about it5) Lots of connectivity options - I think this is what you get the more you pay. This one has plenty of HDMI in and 2 out. I know my Denon did not have an input for our Wii, which used RCA connectors, but this one does.6) Zone 2 - This would be an important feature for me because I also have outdoor speakers I use as Zone 2, but I am now using my old Onkyo as a dedicated outdoor amp. This Onkyo has a powered Zone 2 feature (important if you don't have a separate outdoor amp). I haven't tried Zone 2 on this amp, but the previous Onkyo remote had a Zone 2 controls I never did get down. There does appear to be some changes to this Onkyo's remote, so maybe they made Zone controls easier (maybe other reviewers can touch on this)7) Good sound - I am not an audiophile, so I can't go into the technical aspects of this receiver. All I know is that the thing is powerful and it sounds great. It helps to have a bunch of good speakers, though. I think if you just need a really competent AV receiver, this level of specs/features has just about everything you need. They claim it is future proof because it supports 4K video, 21:9 display format, HDCP 2.2 and a bunch of other stuff I'm not really up on. But, I guess if I get them in the future, I'm ready8) Workable smartphone app - I actually prefer using it to the remote sometimes. It also impresses your friends at parties the first time they see you use itCons:1) Auto sound settings software - In my review of the Denon, I praised the ability of the Audyssey MultiEQ XT. Onkyo has been a client of Audyessy for a while, but now they are using either a completely new software of their own or a modified version of an Audyessy product, AccuEQ (the fact they use \"EQ\" in the name hints it might be an Audyessy product). I do like it the AccuEQ, but not nearly as much as the MultiEQ XT. It lacks the \"3D\" effect of sound seemingly coming out of nowhere, filling the entire space from all directions. I miss that. AccuEQ is good, especially handling 7.2 speakers, but it just doesn't have the same sonic effect on my ears. I will continue to tinker with it, but it is a let down (of course, if you never used Audyessy before, this will still seem like a big improvement)2) Lack of ability to display anything but music from network sources - This is an odd inability. It took me forever to confirm it wasn't built to do it. My last 3 AV receivers could do it. I just expected a network AV receiver to display images (though none display video from network sources, which also seems odd for an Audio Video receiver). To add to the confusion, when searching network sources, it lists audio, images and video categories, and search results will show (and take time to download in the list) image and video files, but if you click on one, it doesn't work. I really think this stinks, especially for the level of model it is. I can still get images, but not video, to display, but I have to go to a connected device (Roku, in my case) to do it. I really can't believe this inability from this receiver3) Poor user interface - This is really an industry wide issue. I have yet to see a truly easy to use and understand user interface. It's take a long time to figure out where everything is, how to get there, what it does and how to use it. In addition, there is inconsistency in the graphic design. Why can't any AV receiver manufacturer create a user interface that is easy to use and looks cool?4) An issue with the volume button - Perhaps it has something to do with the mix of components I'm using, but if I don't turn on the TV, DirecTV box and receiver in a certain order, the volume button doesn't work right. It \"flickers\" between mute and volume. I figured out that I need to turn on the receiver, then TV then DirecTV box in order for it to work. I can remember it, but it's hard for others in the house to do itBottom line is, if you are set to upgrade your system and spend some money on a good network AV receiver and want it to last a long time, being compatible with new technology as you add it in the future, this is a very good receiver to buy.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Lovin' the 7.2", "unixReviewTime": 1400457600, "reviewTime": "05 19, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A1JFGBFN1W5G6U", "asin": "B00IQBSW28", "reviewerName": "Daniel L.

I also own but don't use the original Samsung 10.1 Tablet which I retired when I purchased the fire.  So I'm pretty familiar with Samsung mobile products and Touchwiz.  My laptop is a Asus Zen Ultrabook which is an I7 machine with 256k SSD.  The computer's processing power is great but the weak points are the display and the keyboard.I  played with the Note Pro 12.2 LTE a few times and quickly noticed how fast it was in comparison to my original Samsung Tablet.  Opening up 5 windows at a time didn't phase it and I have never experienced any lag to this day.Since I mostly review Office documents, Word, Excel, Project and Powerpoint, I was anxious to see how the included software, Hancom Office, performed.  So far so good.  I'm typing this review in Hancom Word and have been reviewing both Powerpoint and Excell files these last couple of days with Hancom and I'm more than happy with both its display and editing abilities.  I have a couple of Project apps which I bought for my Note 3 which I have yet to try on this tablet but I assume they will work.You may not know this but Microsoft has released it's Office for Android product but as of today the Play Store shows it as incompatable with this Note Pro.The part of my workflow which I have not overcome yet is email.  I have an antiquated email server which I connect to with Outlook and download mail to my computer.  Of course I can do that with any number of Android mail apps but here's where I've run into a road block.  My email server only goves me 100mb of server space and that fills up quickly with all the attachments I get.  So what I do on my Ultrabook with Outlook is to move those emails off the server into Outlooks local file folders.  What I cannot find in Android is any mail client which allows the creation of Local Folders.  Many will allow you to create IMAP folders biut those folders are then synced with the mail server so that wont do me any good.  What I've settled on for a while anyway is creating 3gig or less in size .pst files which I have copied over to my Tablet.  I'm not copying my whole work are as it's huge but I am trying to get the last couple of years of email over to my tablet.So other than the mail snafu, which is pretty unique to my situation I would think I've been able to migrate over to the tablet.The multitasking is great.  I really dont see myself opening up 5 windows but I have been using two pretty regulaily.  What you see in the ads and reviews is that you can open up four windows, one in each quadrant.  While that's true it is not the way I use it.  What I found is that by sliding open the tray from the right side to uncover your apps, rather than a long press and drag I can simply tap the icon and a resizable window pops up.  This window has the look and feel of a WIndows window and can be resized and placed anywhere on the screen.  It works great and is more flexible than the fixed position multitasking which is often talked about and noted for its inflexibility.So for the included apps, email, Chrome, Youtube, Hancom, Gallery eand a multitude of others have worked just fine. I've not had a single issue.One concern with the Verizon model is that it is only available with 32gig.  That means you really need an SD card if you have a lot of work data or movies to store.  I made the mistake of purchasing a fast UHS-1 80gb/sec Class 10 card which was twice the price of a 30gb/second card and which benchmarks out in the mid teens for both read and write, both in the tablet (tablet storage to ext sd card) and out(PC to tablet file transfer).  I also benchmarked it in the tablet against another card I had, a Class 6 card.  The speed difference was minimal.  Bottom line, dont bother to buy a fast and expensive micro SD card.Unlike the wireless version the Verizon Note does not come with at least two of the freebees, RemotePC and Evernote.  Those two subscriptions are not included with this tablet.  All the other offers are.I did also purchase the ZAGG Cover-Fit bluetooth keyboard and it is a pleasure to type on as compared to my Zenbook.  This accessery is well worth looking at.The tablet has a USB 3 cable/charger and it charges in a few hours if you leave it off.  It will not charge while connected to my Zenbook even though I have it plugged into a charging USB jack.From my perspective the Note Pro is pretty light, feeling half the weight of my Zenbook.  The screen is great.  The speakers sound OK for a tablet but not as good as my Kindle Fire.  The stereo separation is great and you music will sound good if you can live without the richness.My intent on getting the LTE model was to use it in a pay as you go kind of scenaerio...which I discovered Verizon does not have for ths tablet.  I have two accounts both with unimited data so I was reluctant to make any changes but there was no way around it.  I converted the account with the least average data use to a share plan and then added the Note Pro.All in all I think I made a good decision and I'm happy with my purchase.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great tablet and for me an Ultrabook replacement", "unixReviewTime": 1396396800, "reviewTime": "04 2, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A15SCXJHVLY2EZ", "asin": "B00IRBWSMC", "reviewerName": "John", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "I have been very impressed with the sound quality of these headphones.

I will link a few down below but here are the directions for upgrading your PS4 using this hard drive if you want to.If you are wondering if your notebook is compatible with this hard drive just see if it has SATA in the specification information. If it says that then most likely can handle this drive no problem. Almost everything nowadays without internal hard drive is running on the 2.5 inch SATA specification. Another rule of thumb if your hard drive is over 100 GB at present most likely it's a SATA hard drive because of that size and above is when they started utilizing the interface.UPGRADING YOUR PS4 TAKE LESS THAN 30 minutes - You need to download the firmware from Sony*. If you need better instructions just google \"PS4 hard drive replacement\"Step 1: remove the gloss section of your PS4. It's the part above the Blu-Ray slot.Step 2: Remove the 500gb drive (requires 1 screw to be removed) Unscrew the 4 screws holding the drive in the cage.Step 3: Put the PS4 back together.Step 4: Insert your usb flash drive into the PS4 usb slot.Step 5: Press and hold the power button on the PS4 for 8-10 seconds.Step 6: Choose the bottom selection (I believe it's number 10) Reinstall firmware.Step 7: That's it you are done only about 30 minutes and done.*One thing you need if you're replacing a hard drive on the PlayStation is the latest firmware update from Sony's website and you need a 1 GB plus thumb drive formatted in fat32. And you just set up your thumb drive with a folder called PS4 an inside that folder another one called UPDATE.

I was interested because it's supposed to allow you to \"(u)se a standard USB port to charge a Tablet PC or iPad\".  I tried the adapter with a USB port on a Belkin surge protector (seeBelkin Surge Protector) that would NOT charge my iPad2, and it did in fact boost the port's power so that the iPad2 began charging.However, the device didn't work for charging an iPad 2 from a powered Belkin 4-port (USB 3.0) hub (seeBelkin SuperSpeed USB Hub).  The failure was apparently the hub's fault, because plugging the iPad2 into the hub by itself  (without the Sabrent adapter) caused my Win7 system to produce a power surge warning (saying that the device's power request exceeded the port's capability).  Adding the Sabrent adapter didn't change anything--the same power surge warning came up.  So it would appear that this adapter will not necessarily work with every single powered USB port.For me, it's easier to charge iPads and tablets using dedicated 1A ports (as found on newer charging stations, e.g.,CHIL PowerShare Reactor Charging Station) than to use an adapter to try to speed up charging.

This white/silver color uNu AX Tri-USB Car Charger works great and is the best of the four car chargers I own: one of which is difficult to remove from the outlet as well as too small, one of which is an excellent similar dual-USB port car charger, and the third is too large and cumbersome. This uNu charger for automobiles provides the convenience of charging three items simultaneously, for items such as smartphones, coffee cup warmers, GPS units, radar units, and smart tablets (via 2.1A, 2.0A port and 1.0 A ports) while driving around, eliminating the need for \"pre-charging\" the gadgets, swapping gadgets around, or carrying a bulky charger in the car. Plus it is just the right size to allow access to other areas around the center console ashtray area. The big difference with this equipment is it has a bright blue LED that lights up when plugged into the cigarette/power charger outlet to \"confirm connection\". This is a bonus at night when driving: one quick glance and the user can locate and plug in the smart gadgets for charging, although it is preferable to do so after starting the car but before driving to locate the correct port. In addition, when stored, the white color makes it stand out in a glove compartment or center console, amid all of the other darker objects stored there. Chargers should be used after the car is started to prevent power surges from the car's battery and the ports are designed to stop charging when the devices have reached full charge, although I prefer removing the cable from the outlet once the gadget reaches 100% charge.

At just under 3 inches long, it can be inserted into the cigarette lighter socket and allows more access to the center console coin tray and ash tray areas than some other dual-port car chargers. It has a low power blue LED on the top allowing the driver to see the USB port areas in darkness. The USB ports are rated at a total of 4.4 Amps, with one port rated at 2.4 Amps/12 Watts targeted for iPads and iPhones and the other port rated at 2.0 Amps/10 Watts for Android devices, but I've charged iPhones successfully off of both ports with no problems. The ports are inverted so the 'USB cable symbols' on the heads are actually facing away from each other. In testing the charger with the car engine running, a newer generation power-depleted iPhone was `up for use' in 5 minutes and an older generation power-depleted iPhone was `up for use' in 6 minutes using this USB dual charger. The ports are marked with their amperage but blend into the surrounding colors making them difficult to read: but if the LED is positioned to the left, the higher rated 2.4 Amp port is above the other port 2.0 rated port.

With the included hanger, I can hang the X100 from the arm of my treadmill and wirelessly listen to music from my (3rd gen) iPod Touch.In summary, the sound quality is good - this is a single speaker so you can't expect it to reproduce sound with the same clarity and separation as high end equipment.  Yet the sound it does deliver is rich, clear and powerful.  You can use this as a speakerphone if used in conjunction with an iPhone or other smartphone.  I have tried it with an iPhone 4s and the sound quality was good.The X100 specs claim a 30 foot range but I am able to get around 20 feet before the speaker drops out.  Pairing is easy although initially I had trouble (once) pairing the device with my iPod.  Although the iPod could see all the other Bluetooth devices nearby, it could not see the powered-on and discoverable X100.  After some fumbling with the X100 I was able to pair.  I have not had any trouble pairing since.The speaker itself is solid and seems durable.

The speaker is very lightweight, is about the size of a small roll of packaging tape, and the sound is quite clear.  The sound quality is really quite good for this size, and the volume is loud enough to entertain a small group of people easily.  While the speaker touts a 30 ft range, I found that it was more like 20 ft, but this wasn't a huge issue as the MP3 player was always close at hand.The few issues I have with this unit is the durability, the controls, and the small loop to carry the speaker with.  The long term durability of this unit is questionable as it's pretty much all plastic.  Because it's a cheaper unit, I'm not sweating it too much, but I'm really not sure if this speaker would survive a couple of drops.  The controls on the X100 are okay, but it's generally difficult to determine how high the volume is.  It will beep once you get to the highest level, though.  The last problem encountered is with the rope carrying loop.  This loop is very cheap and I can imagine it popping off when clipping this speaker to a backpack or something.  We ended up getting a more durable tie (luggage tag type belt loop) and it works just fine.

Their CD players, radios, turntables, amplifiers and speakers have long been regarded as 'top-of-the-line' by audio enthusiasts.As a rule, their equipment is not in the &#34;Cheap&#34; category and often reminds someone who purchases their first BOSE product that while there are many, many choices that cost less, you often DO actually get what you pay for.This is, indeed, the case with these new BOSE Freestyle earbuds. They do not look like other earbugs, they do not sound like other earbuds, they are not built like.other earbuds - and they do not cost what most other earbuds cost. If your first priorities include both the quality of the sound that comes from your device into your ear and the comfort of that is on and in your ear to receive it, then (providing that you have the money to spend on them) these BOSE Freestyle earbuds are for you!Misc:The case is interesting, attractive and functional, including amply room for extra earbud covers. The microphone and built-in controls functioned perfectly with my IPhone5. No issue with the jack working through the case-cover that I keep on my IPhone. Visually (I am not sure why this matters), they are striking as obvious effort went into modifying and making more visually distinctive a design that has become 'routine.'The Sound:Everyone's hearing is different, so what follow is my subjective experience.The full range of sound is accurately and clearly transferred from the electronic file to the actual sound.  Basses were deep, trebles obvious and the mid-range of the sound spectrum shares equal dominance with the others. IN many lesser earbbuds (or headphones) the mid-range tends to dominate.  I am not an engineer, but the sound sensation is like having small, full-range speaker inserted into my ears,This sound accuracy and fullness was consistent with soft, classical music (acoustic guitar, Gregorian Chants and Yo-Yo Ma), a wide range of folk and blues music as well as with my collection of classic Eric Clapton. No distortion anywhere that I could discern.The Feel:As a rule, I have not been an earbud fan.  There is something about the shape of my ears that makes them all feel somewhat insecure and hard to fit correctly. It took me a few tries to work there cleverly designed ear-pieces into the curves of my outer ear. I actually found the sketches printed in the margins of the fold-out insert quite helpful and not can easily and quickly slide them into place. Once there, they are light, secure and comfortable.All-in-all, these BOSE Freestyle earbuds were a real &#34;ear-opener&#34; for me.

The gel tip for the ear buds provided very little isolation from environmental noise and I found that they didnt fit very well.  However, Robert Esposito (see comments below) suggested that I try theBose StayHear+ tips - medium (2 pairs)instead of the gel tip that came with the ear buds.  It was a brilliant suggestion.  For ten dollars more (the cost of the gel tips), the sound isolation was improved and more importantly, the sound isolation improved the sound quality of the ear buds dramatically.  Plus I find that the StayHear+ gel tips are more comfortable.  If you buy the FreeStyle ear buds, please also buy the StayHear+ tips in your size.Original Review -----------------------------------------------------------I have several Bose headphones and ear buds and I have always been impressed by the Bose products.  Impressed that is, until now.  Although the FreeStyle earbuds reproduce a wide tonal range including bass despite not having a good seal around the earbuds, the sound quality is only a bit better than average which is not what one would expect for the price.Fit and ComfortBose earbuds are different than other brands because they include an extended flexible wing which is basically a extension of the gel cover that sits on your outer ear to add stability and therefore comfort.  I never feel the flexible wing once it is in place, but I do feel that it does help to keep the earbuds in place.What Bose calls the StayHear Tip is a gel cover for the earbud.  Three different size StayHear Tips are provided with the earbuds.  The gel material is soft and supple.  The tip is formed into a funnel shape and the funnel extends into your ear canal when the earbuds are in place.However, although I tried using all three size tips, I never felt that I could get a good fit in my ear.  I also have a pair of Bose 20i earbuds and the gel tips for the 20i are very different.  The gel cover of the 20i forms a cup around the earbud which gives a very good seal around the earbud which has the benefits of making the 20i very comfortable to wear and sealing off the ear canal from outside noise.  In contrast, the FreeStyle gel tips never really feel like they sit properly.  They are still comfortable and the lack of a tight seal means that I can wear them all day.  However, the lack of a tight seal means that the FreeStyle gel tips provide very little noise isolation.CordThe cord of the FreeStyle earbuds is relatively short (a little more than 3 ft long) compared to headphones, but this makes sense since the earbuds are meant for use while being active and you dont want a long cord bouncing around while you are running, for example.  There is a bright, red clip on the cord to hold it in place.  There are also controls on the cord for use with Apple products.  I tried to use the controls with my Android phone and although I could stop and pause music and answer calls, I could not control the volume using the controls on the cord.Sound QualityI have been using FreeStyle earbuds for the past week while listening to different types of music.  I have found the sound quality of the FreeStyle earbuds to be uninspired.  There is nothing really wrong with the sound quality in that they give a well rounded, wide tonal range from the sub bass of dubstep to the highs of classical music.  But, although pleasant enough, the sound is not rich.  The lows are there but dont stand out and the highs are not bright.  Although these aren't studio headphones, the sound is probably close to a flat response.  At this price range, I would expect to be amazed by the sound and I wasnt.I compared the sound quality to that of my Bose 20i earbuds and they were a world apart.  The sound quality of the 20i was so much better.  However, to be fair, the 20i have an inline amplifier for when the noise canceling is on.  But, even with the amplifier off, I thought the 20i were still better.SummaryOverall, the Bose FreeStyle earbuds are average earbuds.  The sound quality is good but not great.

Newell \"Bob\"", "helpful": [7, 10], "reviewText": "Note: Based on reader input this review has been edited and the product rating increased by one star to a total of four stars.Bose has been a famous name for years and I've always followed their products with interest, as back in 1968 Dr. Bose was my instructor for my first class in circuit theory at MIT. He was a brilliant man and many of his company's products reflected that brilliance.This, alas, is not the case with the Freestyle earbuds. While they have many good features, they have some surprising shortcomings, as I'll describe. Here's a capsule summary of my experience thus far with these earbuds.Although I'm not so fond of ear-canal listening devices, because for me they tend to either fall out or else be so tight as to cause discomfort, I have to say that these earbuds are the most comfortable I've ever tried. I hardly even know that they're in my ear. The design includes a small exterior plastic arm that presses lightly against the ridge of your ear to keep the earbuds from slipping out. It's very clever and it really works.Bose is justifiably famous for high-quality audio design. With earbuds, there's not a lot to work with. Most earbuds deliver horrible sound. The Bose Freestyle break that mold and deliver sound that's decent enough. The definition and clarity are outstanding, and the high end is all you could ask, as are the midranges. But it stops there; the bass is largely absent, which is surprising in a Bose product. It's very hard to get earbuds to put out much bass but the Bose engineers could have done better. (I have reviewed another brand and model of earbuds that delivers reasonably good bass; see my other reviews if you're interested.)The end result is that the sound is skewed toward the high end and seems unnatural. Do keep in mind, though, that I did professional sound recording for quite a few years and I'm exceptionally fussy. You might like the sound of these earbuds, as it's very bright and lively. Audio is subjective and no one including a so-called expert can tell you what to like or dislike.I also thought the build quality could be better. The color scheme is a bit unusual, but I can take it or leave it. The problem is the thinness of the wires. It just doesn't look particularly durable, and at the price, you won't want to be buying it more than once. Some readers have, however, reported that the long-term durability is good, so I reserve the right to further edit this review when I have more months of experience with the product (initial Vine reviews have to be completed within 30 days).The last thing is the plug. Now, this headset is advertised to work with iPads and other i-products, and it does, and works well with them. To accommodate remote control through a switch on one of the earbud leads, the plug is TRRS, or four elements, not the common three element TRS stereo mini-plug. This means the headset works fine on nearly all smartphones and tablets. With normal stereo output from a TRS jack on laptops, hifis, etc., I got mixed results. Some devices work fine. Many do not and give single channel output or monophonic output. To fix this, I needed a hard to find and not inexpensive adapter.Readers have told me that in their environment, the TRRS plug works fine with all their devices, and point to older devices as being the ones at issue. While this unfortunately wasn't the case in my own environment (and I have nothing older than 2007 and some very new items), you may not encounter a problem, and if all your listening is on a smartphone or tablet, it's a non-issue.What's the bottom line? These are good, and I'll go four stars, but for less money you can get something better.

This hard drive will work in MacBooks, PC notebooks even PS3 and PS4 and it's a good choice if you're looking to speed up your device as it 7200 rpm's.If you are wondering if your notebook is compatible with this hard drive just see if it has SATA in the specification information. If it says that then most likely can handle this drive no problem. Almost everything nowadays without internal hard drive is running on the 2.5 inch SATA specification. Another rule of thumb if your hard drive is over 100 GB at present most likely it's a SATA hard drive because of that size and above is when they started utilizing the interface.Personally I love 7200 RPM hard drives, for years upon years I have always upgraded my hard drives in my laptops and play stations because I always want to have the fastest load speeds. Now you could invest in a solid-state hard drive and you'll see a better load time by the time of writing this review they are more than five times the price. And most of the time people do not want to drop that much coin if they're just upgrading an older laptop or PS3.Now one thing you might want to do is invest in a larger hard drive at the time of writing this review 500 GB was the max you get on this hard drive at a price of around $65 but on Amazon you can get a 1 TB 7200 RPM hard drive for around $90. To me 500 GB can be a little small but I do a lot of video editing also. But for most people 500 GB will be fine but I always recommend getting the biggest hard drive you can afford.One last thing be sure to buy an external serial ATA case like this one for your old hard drive:Sabrent Ultra Slim 2.5-Inch SATA to USB 2.0 External Aluminum Hard Drive Enclosure EC-UK25 (Black)And then when you replace your hard drive you can put your old hard drive in this thing and use it for backup and file sharing.

Arrived in a very impressive packaging, their presentation showed almost realistic-like 3D water droplets on top of the tray where these sportbuds were sitting. I was honestly expecting to see yet another variation of two earbuds connected by a cable with in-line remote. To my surprise Pump HD has a behind the ear design, but it looked very slick and modern, not like some other headsets I've seen in the past that resemble a hearing aid. I also noticed how lightweight Pumps felt in my hand and hardly even noticeable once placed around my ears. One common problem with earbuds is finding proper eartips for the best fitment to seal your ear canal and also to make sure they won't fall out of your ears during extreme activities. Here, though Blueant included a very generous selection of a total of 7 pairs of eartips (doubles of each S/M/L pairs and a pair of Comply premium awareness tips), and 2 pairs of stabilizers, and a separate cable zip - all this was to enhance the sound isolation and customize cable length. The fitment itself was taken care of by behind the ear design.The headset itself has IP67 rating which guarantees to withstand heavy exposure to wet condition. With a Teflon coating and Kevlar shielding, it blocks water, salt, dust and sweat from entering the headphone set. Also, the micro-usb recharging port (with a high quality cable included in accessories) has a durable seal cap. All the Bluetooth button controls are sealed as well. The included blue eartips seems to be made out of durable silicone material and with a right size selection provide a decent noise isolation. But if you need to be aware of your surrounding, Blueant also included a pair of premium Comply Awareness tips that allow background noise. To compliment it's durable built, Pump also includes a durable lasting battery for up to 8hr of play - a very impressive performance!Wireless pair up was very easy, and it got connected to my phone and media audio without any problem. It supports all the common Bluetooth profiles, such as A2DP, AVRCP, HFP, and HSP. Using multifunction Play button, easily distinguished by raised profile on a side of right earpiece behind your ear, you can play/pause and pick up a call with ease. Volume up/down buttons, shaped as plus and minus, are used to change the volume and also to skip tracks next/prev. The wireless range was very impressive as well, I was about 50+ feet away from my phone across 2 rooms and it was playing without a problem. Blueant claims 100ft wireless distance which I still have to test, but in my opinion it's probably in the open area and with hair out of the way without covering headphones. I also run a number of calling tests, and it sounded very clear on both ends.Now, let's see how this sound translates into steaming audio. Here, things got a little more interesting. Though using Bluetooth 3.0, Pump actually supports AptX and AAC codecs to provide high quality audio without a typical wireless compression. As a matter of fact, this is a first time ever I have seen a non-audiophile company to disclose frequency response of their headphones. They are definitely very proud of their 12.5mm customized dynamic driver, and v-shaped sound tuning. But for me it was a mix bag of impressions. It's not fair to judge sport headphones comparing them to audiophile in-ears, but sound is as important as the durability and design appeal. These headphones has a very high emphasis on deep punchy bass. When you exercising - beat is driving your motion, and Pump will really pump you up with a strong beat! Mids were recessed, typical for v-shape sound, but then toward the upper mids and treble instead of going back up, it rolled off down killing the clarity and the sparkle of high frequencies. As a result, overall sound has a nice driving rhythm but it's veiled with overpowering bass and not enough clarity and details in vocals. So what does it mean? By default with your smartphone audio player without any EQ setting the sound might not be your cup of tea (it wasn't mine). The good news - it can be easily corrected with EQ by boosting upper mids and highs around 5k region.  I guess this is just a general comment for a lot of sport headphones where I would prefer to have a more balanced sound with some default bass enhancement and let me tweak EQ further to fine tune it, rather than tweaking EQ setting for different headphones in order to enjoy it from get go.If you are into pushing yourself to the limit while exercising, if you find that you have to go through a new pair of headphones every few months because they break under your sweat, if you have to constantly adjust the fitment of your current headphones because they don't stay in place, and if you are not getting enough of daily &#34;bass&#34; to drive you to your next workout goal - Pump HD is calling your name!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The most durable sport headphones with a great bass to pump you up! :)", "unixReviewTime": 1400025600, "reviewTime": "05 14, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A3LTVWLFM988AY", "asin": "B00ISRUFSY", "reviewerName": "Zane Ross \"Mr_Armageddon\"", "helpful": [6, 8], "reviewText": "I have owned quite a few stereo Bluetooth headsets (Jaybird Bluebuds X, Denon WorkoutFreak, Plantronics BackBeats, etc).

However, There's definitely a lot of additional functionality that is available on this device that isn't on the My Book Live Duo, such as the ability to set up backups to other drives on your network or even remote (cloud) storage services like Amazon S3.

It seems a little more straightforward, but perhaps that's because there are fewer options, I don't know.

Davis \"famousdavis\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "QUICK SUMMARY:  Easy installation, quiet, expansive Ethernet switch could be the only Ethernet switch you'll need.  Recommended.BACKGROUND:  In my tech-infused home, this 24-port Ethernet switch was a welcomed replacement to a Linksys 4-port Gigabit I was using.  Before installing this Blurex 24 port switch, I had to unplug/re-plug Ethernet cords into the 4-port switch depending on what I needed to be connected.  Now, I've got everything connected with plenty more ports to use later.WHAT I LIKED:- Great performance at gigabit speeds.  I moved 2GB and 4GB files very quickly, with burst speeds of 150MB/sec and sustained speeds of around 80-100MB/sec.  That's consistent with what I would expect given my hardware.- No fan means quiet operation- Thankfully, Blurex decided to use well-lit green indicator LED lights rather than the blinding blue lights so often used- While this is rack-mountable, I used the supplied four rubber feet to place this atop my roll-top deskWHAT COULD BE BETTER:- The ports are positioned in a 2 row, 12-port configuration.  The indicator lights, however, are not intuitively positioned in a similar 2 row, 12 light configuration; rather, they used a 4-row, 6-light configuration, and port 1 is in the bottom left corner, not the top left corner.  Maybe that's how switches like that are normally labeled, but it's not intuitive.- The labels next to the lights are easily confused because the labels are essentially between two lights (is port 4 on?  or port 8?)- The labels themselves are in a very small font- Because my installation doesn't involve a rack, the cables come up over the top of the switch to connect to the front of the switch.  I would welcome a design that would allow either connecting cables to the front OR the back of the switch.  To do that without having 24 ports both in the front and the back, just allow users to insert a power cord either from the front or the back, and having 24 LED indicator lights on the front and back, both.  Then, for installations like mine, where I'm connecting a bunch of devices on a computer desk, the cables are connected to the back of the switch, not the front.Likely, this unit will be purchased by businesses with an Ethernet network that is larger than the typical home user's network.  If you're a home user or small business user, think through how this switch will be installed and make sure you're okay with the end result.CONCLUSION:  Buying a switch is a install-it-and-forget-it device.  Or, it should be.  Now that I've installed this Blurex 24 port switch into my home environment with gigabit speed performance (in a real world setting), I hope to forget that it's there.

I have been quite happy with them for what they are.  The &#34;SoundTrue&#34; on-ear headphones are a modest update, and fill the same niche.  Consequently, my thoughts on them are pretty similar to my review of the OE2s.That said, let's start with what the SoundTrue on-ears are, and what they are not.  These are not for your hardcore audiophile.  What they are is remarkably light and comfortable, with sound quality far better than what you would expect for that.  This is what Bose does better than anybody else.  Can you get better sound quality?  Absolutely.  Can you get it for less money?  Yup.  But, and there's a big &#34;but...&#34;  For most users, it won't matter.  Here's the dirty little secret about sound quality.  If you are listening either to compressed files, or even lossless files through your computer's built-in digital-analog converter (DAC), you get what economists call &#34;diminishing marginal returns&#34; for better headphones.  The biggest impediment to sound quality if you are listening through a computer rather than a regular stereo is the computer's built-in DAC.  Most just aren't very good, so even really high-end headphones won't give you an ideal listening experience.  Plug your Bose headphones into a regular stereo with either a cd or a well-cared-for vinyl, compare them to some respectable but cheaper pairs, and you can get better sound quality for the money.  Run that comparison on your computer and the differences become negligible.  Your built-in DAC is what limits your sound quality more than your headphones once you get to decent enough headphones.  This particular line of Bose headphones nearly tops out the sound quality that you can get from many computers' built-in DACs.  Plug a really high-end pair of headphones into your computer, and it won't sound that much better than these.  So why are you paying more for the Bose?  For the comfort.  Pure and simple.  These are ridiculously light-weight, and you can hardly notice wearing them.  And yet you get the kind of sound quality that is about as good as you'll get without an external DAC, particularly if you are listening to compressed files (which you shouldn't do, but I digress).  If you want sound quality, don't listen to compressed files, and don't use your computer's build-in DAC.  Then, you can get better sound for cheaper.With that out of the way, how do these compare to previous Bose headphones?  The design is basically the same as my OE2 headphones.  The sound quality is at most a modest improvement-- they sound pretty similar, although the same volume setting on a device gives me lower volume on these newer headphones.  I think they want me to think that I can hear more of the quiet details on these newer phones.  If so, the difference is pretty subtle-- I'm not sure how much more I can hear.  In terms of sound quality, any improvement over the OE2 is minor at most.There are two design differences.  There is the volume control thing in the cord, which is nice to have.  However, the jack no longer angles the cord.  The cord now sticks straight out from the jack.  I find this irritating.  Plugged into my laptop, that means a cord sticking out to the left farther than I would like.  Plugged into a mobile device, it could get jostled around in your pocket.  Yes, it's a minor thing, and I would probably never pick a pair of headphones based on the angle of the cord at the jack.  At the end of the day, this is basically the OE2 with a few updates.  They are remarkably comfortable, and with better sound quality than you would normally expect given their size and weight.  Sound quality doesn't get dramatically better if you are listening the way most people listen these days anyway.  You are paying for comfort.  I like them, but only for casual listening.

Everyone has his or her particular tastes, and what sounds \"phenomenal\" differs from person to person.  Variables such as the genre of music preferred, purpose of the headphones, (ie watching movies, listening to music, or the spoken word in general) and personal preference regarding balance of sound, must also be factored in.I recently reviewed theBose SoundTrue Headphones On-Ear Style, Purple/Mintand I was able to compare those with two other models of headphones on the market. I was not able to do so with the over-the-ear since the only over-the-ear cans I have are a pair of Sennheiser HD 598's which are an \"open\" headphone (and sound amazing), whereas the Bose SoundTrue are \"closed,\" or more of a noise-canceling headphone. This would not have been a fair comparison, in my opinion.I compared different genres of music in differing formats; all were MP3@320kbs, FLAC, or regular CD's. For solo instruments such as piano or classical music, the Bose sound excellent. Artists such as Miles Davis, George Winston, and other instrumentals sound really great. It was when I listened to genres with vocals or a wider, fuller spectrum of sound that my enthusiasm for these headphones waned. I found the Bose to have excellent lows and bottom end, but the vocals and the midrange suffered greatly.  The midrange was virtually non-existent, and the highs lacked brightness, clarity, and the crispness that I prefer. It's like the highs have a film or veneer that prevents the brisk, bright, clear sound from coming through. Vocals reek of a bit too much bass for my taste.Bose have a reputation for a signature sound that people often either love of hate. I gave these 4 stars (3.5 for sound, 4 overall), partly out of respect for people that do subscribe to this particular sound. As stated, the solo instruments like piano and horns, as well as classical music, sound pleasant.  Personally, I would not shell out $179 (the current price as I am reviewing) for a sound that is this unbalanced.Other good things about these headphones are the noise canceling quality.

The fill for an object can also be manipulated from an Object control, for interactive movement for angle, skew, size, and positions of color tabs along the gradient axis with real-time visual feedback. I love it.Transparency options may be assigned as usual, with the addition of fountain, vector, or bitmap patterns, in any of several styles that may be selected from the dropdown list within the Transparency section of the Object Properties panel.Several new Docker panels make workflow much more streamlined. One such favorite is the accessibly convenient panel for Alignment and Dynamic Guides. The work space may be as free of clutter as I wish, simply activating desired angles from the list populated with common angles, or with those added from the custom angle entry. There are buttons for selecting or deselecting all angles for simplicity.The user interface enhancements are cool. X7 includes presets for users who are accustomed to an Illustrator workspace. The user interface looks clean and well-organized. When working on a larger monitor, I appreciate the ability to select from small, medium, or large default button sizes. There is a button on the Dockers window that opens a divided-by-category list of available Docker panels.I am underwhelmed by Font Playground. I do not recall previous versions of this software not showing a font preview&#8230;I suppose I just didn&#8217;t notice. Of course, it is nice to see how a font will look before selecting it, but it seems Font Playground simply acts in a similar manner to the drop down list of fonts within Microsoft Word. I would have expected to be able to select blocks of existing text in my document, and then go to Font Playground to play with them for immediate feedback. Font Playground is simply a Docker window for font previews.Having moved up from the previous suite version, I would have been happy to have gone the upgrade route for the fill tools, and many of the new Docker panels. The addition of Visual Studio Tools for Applications should open up possibilities for many. Website Creator is said to have been worked on, though I do hand-coding, so I did not explore its features. Photo Paint has been given a decent amount of attention, with a Smart Carver that is much more effective and easy to utilize, the artistic capabilities of the liquid tools that were introduced into Draw X6, new brush tools, a generous handful of Effects, image straightening, and several options that elevate Photo Paint to a new level of creativity.Whether new to digital photo editing and illustrative design, or a long-time user of these or similar editing tools, this newest version of CorelDRAW Graphics Suite has plenty to offer. Though quite powerful, this is not software for instant gratification; it has a learning curve to master before one will be effectively joining curves and creating precise, complex objects. Despite its learning curve, this software is a creative powerhouse for anyone who takes the time to master the fundamentals, and the possibilities grow exponentially, the more familiar the interface and its tools become while exploring. This is a well-balanced suite of capable graphics tools, at a price that is quite reasonable for what it offers.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Brilliant Enhancements for a Powerfully Creative Suite", "unixReviewTime": 1401494400, "reviewTime": "05 31, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A3EXFDGQIG316U", "asin": "B00IVFDZBC", "reviewerName": "Less Pain \"Stuart\"", "helpful": [13, 13], "reviewText": "NOTE: Yes there is a new version X7, but sold here on Amazon for $499.99. If you buy X6 here for $265.47 and like it, you can upgrade at Corel.com to X7 for $199.00, total $464.67. Reason to buy box set is at the end of the reviewCorelDraw is a pretty intuitive vector program that has a lot to offer. Please note I have been using one version or another since it's first release. It does some things Illustrator still can't and many essential things (such as curve and line edit) much more easily. There are also a lot of things Illustrator can do that CorelDraw can't (e.g. - non permanent effects, filters, line effects and fills).CorelDraw is also a proprietary format which can have drawbacks - good luck getting some other software to open, import or view a CorelDraw file. Also there have been occasions when a file decides to &#34;become&#34; corrupt (no power outages, successful save, no apparent issues, all good but..) and will no longer open AT ALL, meaning it's do over time. Corel has helped overcome this by supplying some excellent filters for importing and exporting to different formats. There is also a &#34;Publish to PDF&#34; option (why not under &#34;Save As&#34;? - too much like right?) that works pretty well though can be hinky with some effects (tranparancies, drop shadows) but these can usually be successfully worked around.That said, Photopaint, while a very capable program, seems as confusing as Draw seems easy. Photoshop, by comparison, while it can be very complex, seemed easy breezy to grasp the essentials and get going. Capture (for me) sometimes works, sometimes doesn't. Font Manager I have never used myself, though some like it a lot.Why buy the boxed set? Well if you don't, you don't get any of the extra content - fonts, clip art, patterns, etc. except it seems by downloading one at a time and only then if you sign up for a free &#34;membership&#34; which encourages you to be signed in online at all times (mmmmm data).

Specifically, there is no headphone \"out\" jack.  If you are using this in a bedroom scenario and want to hook up a pair of wireless headphones you are left with rather ugly external add-ons as your only recourse.  Not a deal breaker and I would have still selected it over the other options, but it definitely is annoying for a device firmly targeted at \"second room\" viewing to miss this feature.I was shopping for a soundbar to give me better sound quality on my secondary TV (bedroom).  I picked the Sony 370H over the Vizio 2451 (5.1  w/ wireless sub), Sonos Playbar, dedicated 5.1 system, and older Sony units on sale.My buying criteria: (in order of importance)-Good sound for a 10' x 10' room-Able to handle my current setup (cable box, Apple TV, and Xbox)-Ability to mount on the wall-Minimal wiring hassleMy TV has 2 HDMI inputs.  Most soundbar vendors (Vizio and Sonos in particular) seem to design their systems with the idea that the TV will be the A/V switch and pass audio to a \"dumb\" soundbar via the optical out.  Reliance on  the optical out on a TV immediately makes it a mixed proposition whether 5.1 audio will be passed to the soundbar (some TV vendors do, some don't, YMMV).  If your TV doesn't pass 5.1 via the optical out then any 5.1 soundbar has greatly reduced value.  You can potentially get a small HDMI switch and mount it behind the TV, but it is one more reason to look at a dedicated 5.1 system.h/t to CNET for providing the following testing on TV vendors that pass 5.1 over the optical out:[...]Choices I evaluated:-Sonos Playbar-Vizio 4251-Dedicated 5.1 system-Older Sony units (260H or 660)Why I picked this year's Sony soundbar (370H)...I'm a Sonos customer (3 different Sonos purchases throughout the house since 2011).  I really wanted to find a reason to buy this soundbar.  I think they make great products.  Unfortunately Sonos falls under the \"dumb soundbar\" paradigm and relies on the optical out scenario.  Not worth it for a $700 soundbar (more for the matching sub).Vizio 4251 (or it's 2.1 cousin).  I read The Wirecutter reviews (as well as others).  The Internet seems to sing the praises of the audio quality of this soundbar.  It unfortunately also falls under the \"dumb soundbar\" scenario with an optical out dependency.  This makes the back speakers more or less useless from my perspective.  I ruled out the 2.1 flavor of this soundbar because I needed the HDMI inputs on the soundbar.  If I didn't have a strong preference for a built-in HDMI switch on the soundbar I would have considered the 2.1 Vizio.Dedicated 5.1.  I scratched this out due primarily to laziness for running wires cleanly to the back of the room.Older Sony's (260H or 660).  Both are marked down significantly now that this year's units are out.  The 260H didn't have enough HDMI inputs for my setup (though I like it and bought one for my parents for Christmas).  The 660 had the right number of HDMI inputs, but seemed to have a handful of user experience quirks (e.g. hexagonal speaker doesn't mount as cleanly as the rectangular 370H).The 370H didn't have a ton of public reviews when I made the decision to buy.  I bought primarily based on the fact the 260 had so many great reviews and hoped the audio quality was at least \"good\" for it's succesor.  My hope was rewarded and the sound quality is superb (for a soundbar).  The 300W is more than enough power for my space (negating any serious consideration to spend $100 more for the Sony 770).  The subwoofer is wireless so it makes placement supremely easy.  The sub also has a nice feature that allows it to be placed vertical or horizontal.  Maybe the wireless connection to the sub has some degradation in sound, but for practical purposes it's negligible.  Finally the 3 HDMI inputs on this make it perfect for my setup.Minor nitpicks:-Sony includes mounting brackets, but no wall mounting hardware.  You will have to buy your own drywall anchors.  These don't have to be heavy duty anchors, just enough to hold the soundbar.  It would be helpful to have slightly longer screws to give yourself some space if you are running HDMI cables below the device (see below).-Mount leveling.  I did this around the same time I was putting in some bathroom fixtures that included a convenient little \"post-mounting\" level option.  Sony has a simple keyhole wall mount on this.  If you don't measure carefully you will likely end up with extra holes in your walls.-Input / Output placement on the soundbar.  The HDMI output (to TV) and HDMI inputs are on the same side of the soundbar (top side, when wall mounted).  In my setup (from top to bottom) I have TV -> Soundbar -> Sources.  It makes sense to have the output to TV on top of the soundbar, but the inputs are a bit annoying to also have on top of the soundbar.  I would recommend you use longer screws when you wall mount so you can give yourself a bit of space to hairpin the HDMI cables back down to your sources (assuming your sources are physically below the soundbar).  I'm also going to see if a right-angle HDMI connector can minimize a wiring rat nest.All in all, this soundbar is definitely top tier and when evaluated against it's main competition it definitely deserves a top billing.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Decided between Sonos Playbar, Vizio 4251, and older Sony units (bought the 370H)", "unixReviewTime": 1401580800, "reviewTime": "06 1, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A1ZPKKWT79C6HW", "asin": "B00IWQREOE", "reviewerName": "APC Reviews \"APC Reviews\"", "helpful": [17, 23], "reviewText": "The Sony HT-XT1 2.1 Channel Sound Bar with Built-In Subwoofer is for this user a real winner. I have to say that this is a type of product that has been way overdue in coming to market. I am a long time fan of Sony sound bar/woofer systems, and have owned several different models. Although this unit is not intended to replace an AV receiver and speakers setup, or even one of the higher powered super sound-bars, it is perfect for the type of use that many people want a sound-bar for: to provide decent sound beyond the usually dismal audio output of most flat screen TVs.The feature set on the Sony HT-XT1 is very similar in many ways to other Sony sound bars, with the same basic HDMI input switching, sound profiles, controls, etc. But this time they have folded the whole thing, including the woofer, into a fairly unobtrusive and stylish slim box that acts as a pedestal for TVs, but is still thin enough to be tucked into a shelf below the TV level if that is needed. The system also has Bluetooth connectivity with NFC, digital audio decoding for most DTS HD, DolbyTruHD, PCM, Dolby Digital+ modes, an optical audio input and analog audio input, and the now almost obligatory tie in to an almost relevant smartphone app. Sony promotes this as a pedestal base for TVs to sit on. I personally would be a little worried about bass vibration at higher volume shaking up the TV components over the long haul. But for a TV with a wall mount, or for average level listening, or with the unit placed a level lower there should not be any problem.Although it doesn't have super bass, it has more than enough for the sort of bedroom and small living room use it is obviously designed for. If you have a McMansion sized living room or a bedroom the size of an entire 60s tract home then this might not be the best choice. But for more intimate viewing situations, in a small to medium sized room with the viewing/listening position within ten feet or so of the TV, this is a very good choice.Although one can debate the relative bass output of this unit compared to systems with separate sub-woofers, there is no denying that the loss of the separate, usually bulky and hard to place sub-woofer speaker is a big plus in fitting this enhanced sound system into a small living room, den or bedroom. It visually blends in very well with most TVs, sounds great, and is affordable. It's a great addition to the ever expanding line of Sony sound-bar systems.

Particularly with the APT-X feature which almost none support in its pricerange.  Still, I do have a few minor nitpicks.  The LED is _SUPER_ bright.  Painfully so if you look directly at it.  This can actually be kind of bad at night time if you're driving because you have this really bright light source in your car then...  I had to put not one, but TWO LightDims on mine to make the brightness normal.  (This recent trend of all electronics coming with ultra-bright LEDs just to indicate power or whatever is getting very tiresome.)  Also, someone mentioned that it has quite some heft to it.  This is because they've actually added a weight to the inside.  Whether that's a good thing or not depends on how it's being used, but I can't help but to think that many people could probably just glue something on if they really wanted it to weigh more.  I'm actually velcroing it into place, so I pulled the weight out (and they overdid it on gluing it in -- which probably wasn't necessary at all since it's also clipped into place -- so this was a bit tough.)  It's worth noting here that the extra weight added in is room that could have been used for a bigger battery technically.  (But then a lot of us are just running it directly from a USB plug anyway I would presume?)  It also doesn't have quite as good of a filtering as I would have hoped -- particularly on the power input.  I have to leave it plugged in, but this does add some extra noise to the sound picked up from the car itself.  Also, as has already been mentioned before, you must manually fully turn it on or off.  Perhaps since it's Bluetooth 4.0 it can last a good while while on but not connected, but it has that dinky little battery, so this is still very limited and I think someone has already complained that it runs down frequently enough on them this way.  Oh, and as a really minor nitpick, it takes it several moments to register button presses (but that may be more in how the software on the phone itself handles it, so I'm not even sure it's this device at fault.)Those minor nitpicks aside, it's still amazing for its price and I seriously doubt you'll do better at this pricerange right now.  The sound is actually quite good other than the aforementioned insufficient filtering causing extra noise.  I have a fairly decent quality sound system (read quality, not quantity!) in my car, so while it's not true audiophile level, it still shows artifacts very well and I would have noticed if it sounded like classic Bluetooth (which was the main thing I was leery about as plain Bluetooth audio uses a lot of very lossy compression.)  The range is far better than some were complaining about -- I probably got about 30 feet or so before it started to skip when I tested normally.  I suspect those with lower ranges either have a lot of interference or have phones/tablets with weak Bluetooth signals (I have the Nexus 7 2013 edition and Samsung Galaxy SIII, so both are well build devices that didn't skimp on components.)  It even integrates well.  I never take my phone out of my pocket when I get in the car.  I just turn this on, wait a moment, hit play, and it's playing my music.

And love them.-This is a bit heavy/bulky, but still not bad.  Price you pay for wifi.-WiFi feature is great for sharing a picture when not near a computer.  And the shutter/live view feature is great.  Both will come in handy for me and one of the reasons I chose this camera.-Great picture quality!!!-FAST turn on.  Take a picture in less than 1 sec! Amazing.-Some neat, though maybe unnecessary features, like the photo effects. (can always apply them after using your phone app!)-High speed video (slow mo) recording, two speeds.-Don't like the strap.-Has picture orientation. (Take a picture while camera is on it's side, it flips it for you).-Lots of other great features.I have previously owned a Stylus Tough 8000.  I also have a Stylus Tough TG-310 that my mother bought and never used so she gave it to my kids.  We were very happy with the 8000 and it lasted us at least 4 years.  I was washing it off after using it at the beach and then noticed a compartment door was open!  DOH!!!  I opened it up 100% and let it sit overnight and it still worked pretty well, but decided to get a new one just for personal comfort/reliability.The TG-310 isn't as nice as the 8000.  There is plastic on it my daughter ripped.Anyways!  This TG-3 with Wi-Fi!!!  Feels much heavier compared to my other two Tough cameras!  It's bigger and bulkier too.  That's what happens when you put a wi-fi in a camera though, right?  It's convenient to be able to connect my phone to the camera and download a photo!  I wouldn't want to do this often, but for that picture you just want to share, right now! it will be perfect.  On our recent trip (the one where I got our 8000 wet) I used my phone to take a picture of the camera screen to share a photo!  And in the past I have done the same with a video.  So this camera really appealed to me.  And using the phone for a remote shutter will be great!  We have often used timers, but this way I won't have to run into the photo, and I can also use my phone to tell if we're all in the picture with the live view!  It's great!I took a few test pictures and the quality is impressive.  Better than the other two cameras noticeably.  I wish there were more MP options.  You can choose 16, 8, and 3mp (and VGA).  For any of you unaware - anything over 5MP is generally a waste unless you're getting a giant blowup canvas!  5mp takes up less than half the space.  Using a smaller mp setting can make your uploads much faster as well.  I am only just starting to use the smaller mp settings as opposed to the full 12 or 14 my other cameras had.  I would go through each picture and crop and resize anyway.  But - I always keep both copies.  My hard drive is full!  So I will use the 8mp setting on this camera and be very happy with it.I just turned the camera on and hit the shutter and I am AMAZED at how fast I could take a photo!  Instant picture!  Wow!  Great feature!I will finish with saying that I do not like the strap this camera came with.  It is thick and I don't like how it attaches.

It provides added stability in those moments in which the camera has to be hand-held&#8212;especially with long or heavy lenses. I have asthma and some of my medications cause hand-shaking so I try to use a tripod when possible, as well as taking photos in bursts of three in the hope that one of them will be good. There is nothing more disappointing than taking a picture you thought was good, then seeing it on the monitor as a shaky mess even Photoshop can&#8217;t salvage. Unfortunately, I&#8217;ve had a lot of those moments.My little video camera came with a strap similar to this one which made camera holding more comfortable and steady. I had long hoped that something similar would be available for DSLR&#8217;s. I&#8217;m delighted to have found it.Since I started using this camera strap my grip is stronger and the percentage of photos that are steady is really very acceptable. This new way of holding the camera lets me shift the weight distribution in a way that is not only steadier, but also less tiring, and more firm. When I&#8217;m shooting, I can put it down and relax my grip but the camera stays secure. The fabric and padding are soft but sturdy; the design is neutral gray on white with black straps that blend with the camera body. It is completely unobtrusive and doesn&#8217;t call attention to itself. It attaches to the camera with a screw (where you would normally screw in the tripod head) and a strap that threads into the camera neck strap. You could use it as alternate to the camera strap or in addition to the camera strap as I do. To attach to a tripod, all you have to remove is the bottom screw.I can see how this strap would be a big help to someone who will be photographing a long event, such as a wedding&#8212;even if they don&#8217;t have a problem with shaky hands. It will certainly cut down on fatigue and allow the person to concentrate on the picture and  to hold the camera more comfortably even when not taking pictures.Now, if one of my photos shows movement, it&#8217;s usually because the subject moved. This has really returned a lot of the joy of photography to me and, with both my grandchildren back in town; it couldn&#8217;t have come at a better time.I only have two negative comments: that there were no instructions for attaching or adjusting and I had to wing it (which isn&#8217;t my strong suit) and I have to check the screw occasionally to make sure it&#8217;s still firmly screwed in.

Wind", "helpful": [24, 25], "reviewText": "I wasn't sure about Chrome OS. I mean, when it's described you get a sort of &#34;meh&#34; reaction. &#34;So it's all in the browser? It requires being online? It can't run Windows, Android, Mac, or Linux programs?&#34; is what pops to mind. I was in this camp, too. I didn't think a laptop that relies on cloud-based services for 80% of what it does could be useful. Boy, was I wrong!First, though, I'll say a bit about the hardware: Sexy. I know the faux leather top is just a sort of foamy plastic, but it looks and feels nice. The laptop is slim, sleek, quiet, cool, and fast. It boots up faster than anything I've ever owned, save for Android or iOS tablets. The dual USB ports, micro SD card slot (yes, micro, because so few new electronics are bothering with full-sized SD cards anymore), and HDMI port are all nice additions to round out this sleek laptop experience.The keyboard is especially nice. I'm a writer, and to me the quality of a keyboard is important in a laptop design. Equally as important is the quality and sensitivity of the trackpad! I've had laptops with good keyboard that were completely spoiled by the fact that the trackpad was overly-sensitive, causing me to accidentally move the cursor around the screen while typing. None of that happens here. I'm not being hyperbolic when I say this is perhaps one of the best-designed trackpads I've used in decades of computing. I like it even better than the trackpads on my old MacBooks, and those were high quality. It's WAY better than the trackpads on more recently-owned systems like the ASUS T100, the Microsoft Surface Type Cover 2, and my last Lenovo laptop. This was, frankly surprising. I did not expect to like the trackpad this much-- Especially since I've never been very fond of trackpads in general.The screen is sufficient for a system designed for getting some work done. The resolution could be higher, but having an HDMI port built in mitigates that problem if I'm looking to push more pixels.Speedwise, I'm quite happy. It doesn't lag with multiple tabs open and handles Chrome OS games quite well. Web-based games also seem to be snappy. I doubt most people will feel they're being cheated on speed or graphics performance, considering this is a Chromebook.Which brings me to my new-found acceptance-- indeed, admiration-- of the Chrome OS. I honestly didn't think I'd like Chrome OS this much, but I've been swayed over from having a &#34;blech!&#34; reaction to having a &#34;I think I'll do that on my Chromebook&#34; reaction. What I mean by that is that the Chromebook is so quick to load, such a pleasure to interact with, that when I need to do some basic work, get online for any reason, or even check out some media, the Chromebook is quickly becoming my go-to device. it's on -instantly- when I open that lid. Chrome remembers all my settings, and Google Drive transfers all my data from my desktop whenever I need it. It functions just like Chrome on my desktop PC, meaning I can go to my work website and not have to worry about missing plugins or not supporting the web protocols (unlike most Android tablets). It's just a pleasurable, easy experience.Here are some questions I had about Chromebook, along with the answers I learned:&#9658; &#34;Can I run MS Office on it?&#34;No, but it comes with Google Docs built in, and Google Docs lets you view, edit, and create MS Office documents. It's not as comprehensive as a fully-featured MS Office suite, but most people don't even use 50% of Office's features, and as I've learned, pretty much everything the average user would need is available in Google Docs.&#9658; &#34;Can I watch videos in Chrome OS?&#34;There's a built-in video player, and you can get others in the Chrome Web Store. You can also view movies and TV shows from every major streaming service like Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, Crackle, CinemaNow, and of course YouTube, DailyMotion, and other sites.&#9658; &#34;Can I view and edit photos?&#34;Yes! Viewing, of course, is built into the system. Editing can be done with a variety of Chrome apps and extensions, like PicMonkey and Pixlr Editor. Pixlr Editor is very similar to Photoshop.&#9658; &#34;Couldn't I just get a regular Windows/Mac laptop and use the Chrome browser to get the same stuff?&#34;Yes, you can access most of the apps and sites from Chrome on any system, but the appeal is the speed with which Chrome OS runs, the fact that you don't have all the other OS stuff running in the background, looking for updates, waiting for things to load, etc. It's the same experience, but on a Chromebook it's MUCH faster and easier.&#9658; &#34;If I can't run Windows programs or Android apps, then how do I download an antivirus?&#34;You don't need to!!! That's another awesome thing about Chrome OS-- It isn't vulnerable to viruses, trojans, worms, and other malware by design. Right out of the box, you're up and running without needing to connect to an antivirus service, pay for a subscription, or deal with background scans or downloads slowing down the system. Chrome OS is secure. You never have to worry about all that stuff. Just get online and get work done.&#9658; &#34;Can I play games?&#34;Yes. There are plenty of web-based games, and the Chrome Web Store has several games to choose from. Now, you might not have some popular games like Minecraft, but there are still some quality games to play and waste some time. If you're looking for hardcore gaming, you and I both know you're never going to look at a Chromebook as a serious contender, but then, you're also not going to find a super-thin, super-light, super-fast gaming laptop for anywhere near this price.&#9658; &#34;Does it always have to be online?&#34;No. There are many offline apps available. Head over to the Chrome Web Store and check out the &#34;Offline Apps&#34; collection.&#9658; &#34;What about basic functions?&#34;Calculators, note-taking, calendars, alarm clocks, translators, banking apps, and all manner of basic applications are available, and they are fast!Finally, I asked myself how much of my time at my computer is spent online. I was surprised at the answer: &#34;practically all of it&#34;. I honestly don't run all that many programs offline these days. Most of my time is spent on the Web, with lots of time spent in email, shopping sites, work websites, entertainment sites, etc..  If you really examine what it is you do with your computer or tablet, you might find the same thing. I'm not even a big fan of social media like Facebook or Twitter, but I know lots of you folks are, and again the Chromebook is going to handle those tasks admirably well.So who is this thing for? Anyone who needs a fast, light, thin laptop to get online, do some work, watch some videos, play a few games, edit some documents or spreadsheets (Google Docs), edit some photos (Pixlr), edit some videos (WeVideo is pretty cool), do some basic CAD (AutoCAD360), check Facebook, send Tweets, check & send gmail, check & send Outlook mail, video chat, listen to music (Google Music, Prime Music), transfer files between systems (Google Drive, Amazon Cloud Drive, Dropbox, Microsoft OneDrive), and even remotely connect to your desktop PC (Chrome Remote Desktop) and work on it from afar.Who wouldn't benefit from a Chromebook? I guess if you need a laptop that will play the hottest, newest games in 3D, a Chromebook isn't for you. If you need to do super-intense professional video editing on your laptop you'd best go for something Windows, Linux, or OS X based. If you need to run a very specific piece of software on your laptop and can't find the Chrome OS equivalent in the Web Store on on any website, you'll have to go with the system that software was made for.For everyone else, the Chromebook is the nearly-perfect laptop. It combines insane boot/wake up speed, essential functions, and excellent hardware design into a laptop that handles most functions modern Internet dwellers need.I would say the Chromebook is especially great for people who aren't all that tech-savvy. They'll never need to sit through a Windows update, a virus scan, or get a BSOD. They'll never have to figure out some ultra-technical way to make the computer do something, because Google really does make almost everything insanely easy and fast. There's just not much to screw up on a Chromebook!However, I do have ONE minor gripe about the Chrome OS, which is why I'm only giving four stars instead of five in this review. Currently, Chrome OS does not provide an easy way to turn a web page into a desktop or taskbar icon. You can bookmark any page, just like in Chrome, but you cannot drag a URL to the desktop or taskbar and make it into a clickable launch icon without going though some convoluted steps. It CAN be done, but not easily. From what I have read, Google is aware that people want this feature and they're working out how to do it with just a couple clicks. For now, however, you're stuck opening the Chrome browser and clicking the link in your Bookmarks, or finding an official Chrome app/launcher/link that provides one-click access.This is a minor caveat (and as I said, one that Google is working on) and so it's only costing a star from this review. Have no fear, however, about the hardware involved here. The Chromebook 2 is a fine example of sleek, sexy laptopping (I know. &#34;Laptopping&#34; isn't actually a word. I still like it.) and I'm certain that anyone who gives it a chance will love what they can do with the Chromebook 2.&#9658; Final Verdict: FOUR STARS.&#9658; Recommendation: Unless you're an elitist, professional video editor, hardcore gamer looking for a portable rig, or a Google-hater, you probably want to get one of these to complement your other Windows/Mac/Linux PC, or to stand alone as a simplified way to get online, get work done, and have a little fun.

Sound quality is decent (I use headsets mostly for listening to sports and religious podcast rather than music so sound quality is not a top priority for me). The Senbowe headset is a a good value for the price and thus I would recommend to those looking for a light wireless headset to wear during workouts (not running though). The only drawback for me is the ear buds do not fit snug in my ears. To alleviate this problem I purchased a set of ear bud covers (from a dollar store) and this dramatically improved the fit without sacrificing sound quality.There are better quality wireless headsets on the market but none at the price of the Senbowe.

Charme", "helpful": [5, 5], "reviewText": "I received this at no cost in exchange for writing a review. Here are my comments.[Note: Based on a lot more extensive use after my initial review, I have downgraded these from 4 stars to 2 stars. See my Update below].1. The included directions are among the worst I've seen, so let me point out a few things.A. The power button to turn this on is located on top of the right earbud (the directions have no illustrations).B. Hold the power button down until it alternately flashes blue and red, which is the pairing mode. On my iPhone 4S the headset appeared as S301 and paired without having to enter any codes.C. This comes installed with medium size earbuds, which worked fine for me; also included are large and small earbuds.D. There are two plastic loops. Attach one to each earbud to keep this in place on your ears.E. The cord connecting the earbuds is too short to wear in front because it was right up against my chin. So I put it behind my neck and this headset fit perfectly.2. The earbuds passed my \"chewing gum test\"--vigorously chewing gum will dislodge many earbuds, but not these. That makes them ideally suited for running and gym workouts.3. This comes with a clunky AC 2.0 mm charger (2.0 is becoming more common). I have 2.0 USB cables that are more convenient to use.4. The sound is the same quality as a pair of Apple earbuds, which suit many people just fine. Of course there is no lush sound or deep bass, but it's not realistic to expect that at this price point. I turned up the volume on the headset to maximum since I prefer to make volume changes directly from my iPhone.5. The ear hooks can easily come off during handling and are a bit flimsy.Bottom line: For exercise and gym workouts these are very handy. These also work well to drown out loud voices in my office without wearing a conspicuous headset.At this price point I think this headset is a good value. I have not seen a lighter or more compact bluetooth headset. However if bluetooth and light weight are not critical to you, there are certainly better sounding--and more expensive--headsets.Update May 26, 2014: These are more flimsy than I thought. Not only do the ear hooks come off easily, but so do the ear buds. But there are two serious issues I have discovered:1. Even when fully charged, these last no more than 90 minutes. I have gym workouts that often last longer, not to mention my outside runs. Forget this for a long car ride or plane trip.2. The earbuds do not sit snugly in my ears, no matter what size I choose. That causes a deterioration of the sound, which is much better if I hold the earbuds in place. Of course that's not practical and not something I'm going to do.I'm going to stick with myAvantree Jogger Pro Sweat Proof Wireless Bluetooth 4.0 Stereo Headphones / Headsets with microphone for running / sports - Black/Grey. They cost more and are larger, but are in another league in terms of performance and durability.Even at this price point, I think you're better off buying something else.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Updated Rating 5/26  4 stars to 2 stars--Not recommended", "unixReviewTime": 1398729600, "reviewTime": "04 29, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A3RC2OSA1WWYJ3", "asin": "B00J5O7BMC", "reviewerName": "AaronSquire", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "The radio option opposed to infrared is SOO much better.

I will try to review this product from a chronologic order perspective.Day 1 &#8211; System arrives.  It comes via UPS in a 36x36x36 box weighing about 75lbs.  It&#8217;s got &#8220;HEAVY&#8221; and &#8220;TEAM LIFT&#8221; orange stickers all over it.  I had to drag it into my house, then proceed to open it.  There appears to be another 17 smaller white boxes in this big box.  1 box for the main DVR / Control unit, probably another 8 boxes for cameras (4 in each box), and another 8 boxes for all the wires and power supply. You get the idea.Day 7 &#8211; Okay, so I&#8217;ve sketched out where to install my cameras.  8 inside the house (just about EVERY room except the restrooms) and 8 on the outside of the house.  That&#8217;s TWO cameras on each side of my house for full coverage.  Hmmm&#8230; Not sure what to do with the other SIXTEEN cameras.Day  14 &#8211; THIS IS THE HARDEST PART OF THE WHOLE SET UP!!!!  Running all the wires in my attic to every part of the house.  I get about 3 wires done. It&#8217;s quite hot in the attic.  Maybe I should start earlier in the morning tomorrow.Day 15 &#8211; Hire a handy man to run wires in the attic.  There are TWO wires for each cam.  The power wire and the signal wire.  Handy man pulled the remaining wires.  Poor guy.  Did I mention it&#8217;s really hot in the attic?  Dusty, too.Day 16 &#8211; Well, since the handy man ran all the wires, I decided to have him install all the cameras, too.  Installing cameras is no piece of cake.  You have to lug a ladder around, drill holes, screw in the mounts, then screw in the camera, then connect the cable.  Climb up and down the latter to grab screws, drills, mounts, camera, and multiply that by 16 times.  Woo-wee I&#8217;m getting tired just watching the guy.  Think I&#8217;ve done enough for today, time to take a break and have an ice cream cone.Day 21 &#8211; Today, I take the 16 signal wires, power supply, and Ethernet cable, plug them all in, and power up the unit.  Just to make things easier, I had to pull my HDMI monitor from my home workstation and plug it into this unit during initial set up.  Cameras are working, I can see them on my monitor.  Time for a beer.Day 22 &#8211; Chose one of the options for network set up (DHCP, Static IP, Direct to Modem, or DDNS).  I choose DHCP.  Follow the quick start guide closely, write down all the numbers you see, configure your router for port forwarding, and voila, you are now up and running and the world can see what the inside of your house looks like.By the way, I am an IT professional that is quite familiar with networking protocols and gadgets.  If you are not a &#8220;technical person&#8221;, I have one word for you &#8211; forgetaboutit!Day 23 &#8211; Once all the networking stuff is out of the way, I can monitor my house inside and out from the internet.  Picture quality is good, very clear.  However, the picture does slow down if you are looking at multiple cameras at the same time, but that might depend on broadband speed.  Everything can be configured using your PC browser.  I have not fully mastered it yet, but I am current in the midst of the &#8220;recording&#8221; configuration.  The system is has a motion detection feature, where it only records when it senses motion.  This is so you are not constantly recording nothing and taking up hard drive space.  I can use my PC or android phone to monitor my house.Epilogue:After a few weeks with the system, I am quite pleased.  I travel quite a bit for work, so I get to watch home from my phone or hotel room.  It&#8217;s quite comforting to know when I have packages, whether the gardener showed up, or if the trash was picked up.  Mostly, it&#8217;s like bringing a piece of home with me on my travels.  Once the system is set up, it&#8217;s pretty much on auto pilot.I&#8217;ve never needed it, but I see that I am able to pull up past files.  All files are date and time stamped, so it&#8217;s easy to locate.  I think old files are deleted as the hard drive is filled up.  But with motion detected recording and 3TB of hard drive space, archive files can get quite old.One last thing.  I have to clean my cameras once every few weeks.  At my house, spiders tend to weave webs in front of the cameras.  Those webs really show up during night vision.I&#8217;m happy with the system, but your mileage might vary.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good Home Surveillance System-Takes Time to Set Up", "unixReviewTime": 1405382400, "reviewTime": "07 15, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "ABCNO99OFECJ0", "asin": "B00J6CGGSI", "reviewerName": "R.

Today, I got my Phantom 2 Vision+.  In a short time, I had it flying, in exactly the same location as my first Vision.  In three 25 minutes flights, I was never able to maintain a solid GPS lock for more than ten seconds at a time, and it kept going in and out the entire time.  Also, on my second flight, my display turned to solid gray bars for most of the flight.  I never had such problems with my basic Vision.  Is my Vision+ a lemon?  Is anyone else having such experiences?Today I flew my Vision+ alternately with my Vision in exactly the same location three times each.  The Vision was always able to get and maintain a GPS lock; whereas the Vision+ took a long time to acquire a lock and kept losing it every few seconds.  Unless there is something I'm forgetting or doing wrong, I will have to return my Vision+.  Any suggestions?After 5 more flights my Vision+ is still not able to maintain a GPS lock for more than a few seconds.  Once it flew away and landed in a field about a quarter mile away.  These were just test flights, but I can't afford to have such things go wrong when I'm flying it over open water or mountainous terrain.

Yes....it really IS made of glass folks!I had ordered a cheaper film which I applied and used while I was waiting for the second GLAZZ to arrive, and that kept the dust and oils off of the screen while I was waiting for delivery of the replacement.  It did a fine job, but it smeared rather badly.When the replacement arrived, I carefully did NOT drop it onto the floor.  I removed the other film, which lifted clean without leaving any residue on the tablet.I used the hinge method to apply the GLAZZ screen protector - applying removable tape along one long side to be sure of the alignment first, flipping it back, cleaning the screen of any dust using more of the removable tape, then removing the protective film from the GLAZZ screen cover and laying the adhesive side down on the tablet.  This is a stiffer screen protector than regular films - when I flipped it over, it gently laid ITSELF down perfectly on the tablet - no air bubbles formed.  Period.There was one minute speck of dust at one edge that I missed, I was able to lift that edge easily and remove the speck without any trouble.  Again, the screen protector aligned itself perfectly with no air trapped underneath.  I've never seen such a freakishly easy application.But the real difference with this screen protector, and the reason I am happy that I got a second one after messing up the first one, is that despite being perfectly clear, the GLAZZ does NOT show fingerprints!

I recently reviewed their Pro 500 headphones. I thought they sounded superb - slightly warmer than neutral with a solid bass - but that they had some ergonomic issues that included a clamping force which was a bit too tight and ear cups that were slightly small. This limited listening periods to about an hour or two before they became uncomfortable to wear.The new Yamaha HPH-M82BL High-Definition On-Ear Headphones have no such ergonomic issues. They are remarkably comfortable with plushly cushioned foam ear pads that sit weightlessly on the ears. I've worn these headphones for as long as four hours without a twinge of discomfort. The twisted metal headband, which I presume is some sort of fashion statement, seems sturdy enough and adjusting these phones to match my largish cranium was easy. There is no worrisome tension on the headband that might lead to cracking (I've had that happen). The rest of the body of these headphones is constructed of plastic that is shaped with a pleasing minimalist aesthetic. These phones are very comfortable and you won't be embarrassed to be seen wearing them outdoors.These are not expensive ($200 and up) headphones and their sound quality is good for their sensible price point. I listened to a broad spectrum of music that included Classical, Rock and Jazz of all varieties. The HPG-M82BLs possess a rather bright treble and a so-called \"bass hump\" that makes for a forceful low mid-range and solid bass extension: reflecting Yamaha's apparent desire to compete with Beats. Mid-range is unaccentuated so vocals are slightly recessed but sufficiently present so that the music is unaffected. All of these attributes give the Yamaha HPH-M82BLs a sound signature that has a V configuration (accentuated lows and highs with a slightly recessed mid-range).These aren't noticeably warm headphones but their sound is quite pleasing overall. They have a narrow soundstage, like most closed headphones, and musical transparency is somewhat limited. Overall, I thought these better than comparably priced headphones I've listened to, with a well-defined though narrow sound stage and just enough transparency to make listening enjoyable.

With this in mind, let me tell the story of two Hi-Res Audio products: the Sony STR DN 850 and the Sony STR DN 1050 (http://www.amazon.com/Sony-STRDN1050-Audio-Component-Receivers/dp/B00JC31SEI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1403792980&sr;=8-1&keywords;=str+dn+1050)  Today, the 850 is exactly $100 less than the 1050, at $498 and $598, respectively (on Amazon).Before we get started, some background information:What is Hi-Res Audio?In home theater, there are always people who are looking to improve their experience. (I am one such person--going to the movies is not my favorite thing to do anymore with people talking, on their cell phones, and coughing in my general direction.  But I digress...)High-Res Audio is generally only a marketing term, but describes audio signals that exceed the bandwidth of CDs, and have sampling rates greater than 44,100 Hz and bit-depths greater than 16 (or equivalents).  Their formats include FLAC, ALAC, WAV, AIFF, and DSD (also found on Super Audio Compact Discs--if you've never tried, it, do.  It's amazing).What is a sampling rate?Basically, a sampling rate gives you the number of \"samples\" of audio per second (in Hz or kHz--one kHz is 1,000 Hz).  The more, the better. The more samples, the greater the maximum frequency (i.e. a sample rate of 8 kHz=3.6 max frequency; a sample rate of 96 kHz=43.6 kHz max frequency).An audio CD has a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz (giving a 20 kHz max frequency). This was thought to be the highest frequency generally audible by our human ear (the older you get, the more this number falls).(A note: higher than 44.1 sampling rates are used to record wildlife and other specialized situations, such as when sound is slowed down, which would in fact lower that sampling rate back to where we can enjoy it at our own limited max value.)High-Def Audiophiles disagree with the 44.1kHz human limitation (and so do I). The biggest detractors saying that High-Res Audio is nothing more than a marketing ploy to get us to purchase the \"latest and greatest\"...But I can honestly tell you that there IS a difference for me, personally.  I actually have a bit of a hearing deficit and have a tough time with understanding speech, especially on television and DVDs.  When I hear a High-Res Audio sound file, the sounds are clearer and I can easily understand what is being said. I also hear nuances in music that meld together using normal CDs.  Hearing isn't all about one unit of measure, as any hard-of-hearing person can tell you.High-Res Audio files can be retrieved online and via other sources, but you need a unit that can actually play those files.  This is where the Sony devices come in.A first basic difference: the 850 has 150W of power...the 1050 has 165W.  Why is this important?  If you were comparing two different brands, this isn't as important because of inherent variables in the \"Watts per channel\".  However, given that these two units are alike, the db ratings, distortion, signal-to-noise ratio, dynamic headroom, and total harmonic distortion ratings are all the same, so Watts simply means that you can go louder without losing quality with the 165W unit.  Beware comparing simply Watts across brands (and even within brands if comparing upper-end v. lower-end units), as the louder does not necessarily mean the better (it could be louder, but lose quality in the inherent variables).Sony uses a 2-channel system in their home theater systems (the 850 and 1050).Both use a 7.2 channel configuration that can be set up with different surround styles. Only the 1050 has a two channel analog audio zone 2 preamp (used in Dolby and DTS).The 850 has 6 HDMI 1.4 inputs and one output.  The 1050 has 7 HDMI 1.4 inputs and three outputs (one independent and two parallel).  One HDMI input on both receivers is MHL-enabled (Mobile High Definition= connects smart phones and tablets to your HDTV, supporting 1080p and 7.1 digital audio; yes you an do this via Bluetooth, but it's a nice addition.) Each receiver also has a USB port (on the front) for flash drives or phones, and wired ethernet or wireless wifi for internet and DLNA network connectivity. Both receivers have Bluetooth (with NFC and Apple's Airplay).The 850 lacks in component and analog options.  While the 1050 has two sets of component inputs and one component output, and has an analog zone 2 preamp output, the 850 has neither of these options.

For the added one hundred dollars, you get a powerful workhorse of a unit, with louder capability and upgraded physical features like that upgraded transformer and capacitor system.  These units will last for years, and over time, that hundred dollars is worth the investment, in my opinion.  (However, if you have a smaller space and have little use for the added component and HDMI capability, then the 850 is a great unit, too.)These units are both easy to set up, easy to use (I love the apps), and will definitely \"up your game\".

I received mine as a review sample from the manufacturer.I'll cover the sound quality first. In a word, it's adequate. Not overly spectacular, but sufficiently loud to be heard over road noise while trekking through streets and paths. I do not view the quality as a problem because in most biking environments the sound level is more important than fidelity. Plus, the safety factor of having a hands-free solution is the major reason for getting one of these.What impressed me is when I turned this on all I had to do is scan for bluetooth devices from my phone and it popped right up. I did not have to press a multifunction button and chant, hoping the device would show up like other bluetooth speakers - it was immediately there.Another thing I love is the buttons are on the top of the case and when the speaker is turned on they light up blue. I have stationary speakers which have buttons that blend into the case so well I cannot readily find them, so this feature removes one major distraction when you are on the road. In the dark the lights are soft enough to not affect your night vision. The only improvement that I can think of is to use red lights instead of blue because those would actually promote night vision. Perhaps the designers will do that in the next generation.Some of the other nice touches are the ample inside space for a phone and other incidentals, plus a ring clip on the outside for your keys. I also love the three point attachment to your handle bar and steering post. It is easy to attach and remove. In fact, that takes mere seconds.Having a removable battery is yet another design factor that makes this a value. Most bluetooth speakers on the market have a fixed, internal battery that will eventually wear out. When the battery in this one inevitably dies you can quickly replace it with a newBL-5C Extended Li-Ion Batteryand you are good to go another 500 or so charging cycles.Finally, the semi-hard case, heavy duty zipper and construction are all first rate and clearly designed by someone who understands the rigors of biking when it comes to gear.

There's even a clip on the outside, if I want to use that.The speaker straps securely on the handlebars of my scooter bike.  I've been riding around the neighborhood on it every day, radio or iPhone blasting.FM RADIOI scanned all the FM stations the first time I used it.  This, so I can just press the forward or back button to go to the next station.  Still, some of the static-only stations were accepted in the scan.  I have to manually skip those.I don't use the radio function much, though.  I can tell I'm listening to a radio, because it's not as clear as when I'm using the Bluetooth function.  Riding around town, some stations come in and out, as radio signals sometimes do.BLUETOOTH SPEAKERBluetooth function is great.  It paired easily and it reconnects with my iPhone as soon as I turn it on.  Sound quality is as good as I can tell with all the road noise and nature sounds I have to hear it over.All the controls are on top of the speaker, so I don't have to open the case to adjust volume or skip tracks.

While the solar charging feature has some limitations, it offers an alternative approach that is unique and unlike any other powerbank I've used.The device itself is a bit on the large size, measuring about 3 inches wide and 5.5 inches long. However, it's only about a half inch thick, so it's not what I'd consider to be ungainly (although certainly not nearly as compact as a conventional 5000mAh powerbank). The larger size is needed to support the solar panel.The build quality is very good. It's billed as being rain-proof, but not waterproof. In other words, getting some water on it is not a problem, but it's not something that can be fully submersed in water and survive.It has two USB output ports, both rated at 1A. The ports are covered with a silicon cap to keep out water and dust. The device itself is wrapped in a \"shock absorbing\" case (basically a thick rubber-like coating) that gives it a decent measure of bump and bruise protection. However, as expected, the solar panel that covers the full front of the powerbank is not protected, so you still need to take some measure of care with this.The overall design is pretty nice looking, with light blue accents and a black front and back. The caps covering the ports are anchored into the case so they can't get lost. It also has the usual \"gas gauge\" to show the charge level left (series of 4 LEDs) and a low-powered, but still useful flashlight. It comes with the usual assortment of connectors/adapters plus a very nice metal hook (spring loaded) so it can be easily clipped and unclipped to a backpack (or pretty much anything with a loop). That's a useful feature considering that this is a good device to have when camping.The solar panel is not intended to be the primary method of recharging, but rather be used in circumstances where you don't have access to a USB charge port. The instructions warn about leaving this in the sun for too long, which is (I assume) due to the fact that it has a Li-ion battery in it, and lithium batteries do not like to get hot.But even if heat were not an issue, it's not very practical to rely on just solar recharging since it is very slow. It took me a few hours to get this solar charged from the 75% level to the 100% level. Still, if solar is the only option you have (such as if you're camping) having a solar panel - even a slow one - is the difference between getting some power or none at all.The 5000mAh capacity and the 1A output make this suitable mainly for phones and small devices rather than tablets.>>>>UPDATE:  The manufacturer contacted me about the above statement and said that the output power is 2A if only one USB outlet is used. That makes the power output better suited to a tablet, but I still feel that a 5000mAh capacity powerbank is not an ideal choice for a tablet. Given the inefficiency of using a powerbank of any type, 5000mAh will not provide for a full charge on many tablets.  For me, the minimum capacity for a tablet powerbank is 8000mAh and, ideally 10,000mAh or more.All in all, it's a very handy device, and brings some unique features to the powerbank table. Well worth considering even though it comes in at a higher price point than a typical 5000mAh powerbank.[Sample provided for review]", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "No power?

It's relatively compact ( 5 1/2 x 2 7/8 x 1/2 inches) and has an attractive rugged plastic case that is supposed to be water resistant and shockproof and impervious to dirt.2. This is rated at 5000mAh and has dual 1A USB ports as well as a built in flashlight.3. Included is a micro USB charging cable along with both regular and lightning Apple adapter heads, plus a carabiner clip to carry this.4. There are four LED indicator lights to show the battery status. A green light comes on to indicate solar charging, and goes off when the unit is fully charged.Note: The directions state: \"Solar charging only for emergency, please avoid prolonged exposure under the burning sun.\" However, in response to my original 4 star review noting this limitation, the seller contacted me to say that the reference to \"only for emergency\" was to indicate that solar charging is slower than electrical charging, and that in fact this unit has been tested for 8 hours on a hiking trip in South China under a hot sun and worked fine. Accordingly I upgraded my review to 5 stars.Bottom line: I think this is great sport charger to bring to the beach, lake or pool. I am going on vacation to a hot sunny climate in a couple of weeks and will see if this lives up to the seller's claim that it can endure hours in the hot sun.Update May 10, 2014: I left this out all afternoon to charge in the blazing hot sun at a hotel in Mexico where I went on vacation. It charged fine and also worked well afterwards. So I have confirmed that this can be left out for hours in a hot sun without any ill effect and will charge.Update May 31, 2014: When I travel I always use the flashlight on one of my power banks as a nightlight, which means it stays on from 8 to 10 hours a day. I was curious how quickly this unit would drain if I left the flashlight on. I was stunned at the results--but in a good way. The flashlight was on 24 hours a day for 7 straight days--and I still had 50% power left. I have much more powerful units that have drained more quickly. Putting aside that this will definitely be the unit I rely on for a nightlight when I travel, it's good to know that in the event of a power failure I have a flashlight that will last more than enough time if I keep it fully charged.Update June 8, 2014: The flashlight has now been on for 15 straight days 24/7 and just now ran out of power.

You are also instructed how to squeeze down the sides to ensure a perfect seal, and to check that the access ports are also sealed. One piece of information that did not make it to the instructions that I received, but did come in an email from the product representative is to leave the audio port open and squeeze all the air out from the inside of the case, then seal the audio port.My description of installing the iPad sounds more complicated than it actually is.

It may not easily fit in a pants pocket or small purse, but does in a backpack and it provides a lot of spare power when you are away from the grid or access to outlets is problematic.Last year it would have been one of the higher capacity batteries on the market, but this year it is in the mid range. For me and probably ninety percent of other users this is not an issue because 10400mAh is a lot of spare capacity. Before proceeding I want to let you know that I always multiply new battery packs by .9 to get a more realistic capacity. That's because there are some losses in efficiency from heat, the transfer process, condition of your charging cable and myriad other factors. Using my quick formula you can expect about 9360mAh from this battery. What this means in real life is if you are using an Apple iPhone 5S with a stock 1560mAh this will provide an additional six hundred percent of use time.  For an iPad 2 with a stock 6930mAh battery it will slightly more than double your use time.I did some quick tests with the aforementioned Apple devices, plus my Galaxy Note 3 and Tab 3 10.1, and this battery pack simultaneously charged up the pair of Apples, then did the same for the pair of Samsungs - and did so as quickly as when I was using OEM chargers plugged into the wall. That is impressive because there is usually some latency when charging from a battery, but I did not notice any appreciable difference.One of the feature that I love is the real LED display that shows exactly how much capacity is remaining down to the one percent. This is a vast improvement over the old style LEDs that would show increments of twenty or twenty-five percent (depending on brand and model). This has a built in flashlight too, so for camping it is a useful feature. A better set of features is the integrated circuit that prevents over charging, loading and discharging, and protects against short circuits. That gives me a warm and fuzzy feeling more than a flashlight.One final thing that impressed me is the price, which at the time of this review is around thirty bucks. A year ago battery packs with the same rated capacity were going for over three times as much, so as the technology improves the price seems to keep dropping. This model is not only priced to reflect that, but has features like the LED display that was lacking on the earlier generation of these batteries.

Based on the Dish DVR the user interface works well.***Update:  6/9/2014Our previous DVR was a good media player with the OTA DVR function \"bolted on\".  I had/has some issues and I fried the tuners trying to fix a problem.The CM7500 has a user interface (UI) from our former Dish days.  We like it very much.I'm using a WD 2T \"green\" HDD in a USB 2.0 external enclosure.  Works great with the CM7500.

I have asked numerous questions and have received answers the next day.  Here is an example explaining the proper way to remove and attach a USB HDD that users might find useful.\"The proper way to remove a disk drive is to simply remove, but then you must wait to see what comes on the screen. It will ask you to reboot the DVR+ so that it will be ready without the drive. Then once the TV program comes back on you will be able to plug the drive back in and make sure to follow the onscreen instructions again. This is the best way to remove and reconnect the hard drive.\"Channel MasterTechnical Support***Update 6/15/14After a weeks worth of using it improvements I would like to see:a) give priority to navigation button response time ( over playback if necessary ).  Presently, too much lag time.b) guide navigation: we have page up/down, jump 1 day forward/back, jump 2.5 hrs back/forward?????  There needs to be a jump 2.5hrs forward button.c) guide option for smaller font with more displayed time slots and/or full screen guide.d) DLNA compatibility ( server, player)e) All bluray players have Netflix, etc.  No need to duplicate this capability.  Focus on providing the best ota DVR experience.***Update 6/23Regarding the button response time mentioned above:I have found that if I pause the TV (either live or playing from a recorded program) screen navigation is much, much faster.  On the other hand, recording programs (one or two)seem to have very little effect on the button response time.  This makes sense if one makes the reasonable assumption that very little cpu time is needed to record programs (just MOVING already compressed video from the tuners to the HDD at 2 x 20Mb/s or 5MB/s, &lt;1% of cpu capacity) while DECODING the compressed video takes >50% of the cpu capacity.  If the cpu is busy decoding the compressed video it can't response as fast to a pressed button.Is USB 2.0 fast enough?  Does one need USB 3.0?USB 2.0 has a max data rate of 480Mb/s.  I have measured 200Mb/s sustained on the USB 2.0 drive I am using.  If one is recording two programs and playing another, the HDD needs to handle 3 x 20Mb/s = 60Mb/s (20Mb/s is the maximum one gets from an OTA ATSC broadcast).  My USB drive can provide 200Mb/s and I only ne/2ed 60Mb/s.  Thus my experience that USB 2.0 works well is consistent with the basic math.Update 7/2We now have quite a few recorded programs and we wish for a more extensive folder/file system.  Currently, files of exactly the same name are grouped in folders.  If you modify the name (e.g. to provide additional program descriptions like episode) the file is no longer placed in the folder.  For example, if one changes the name of a file from \"program\" to \"program\"/\"episode\" the file will no longer be grouped into the \"program\" folder.  I have suggested to CM that the 7500 be modified to ignore \"/\" and everything after it in the file name.  If this is done, one can rename the files to be \"program\"/\"episode\" and they will all be placed in the \"program\" folder.

On paper, the device seems to check enough the right boxes with me so I ordered thru Amazon.My assessment:Pros:- Small, neat form factor.- Easy to use.- When it works, it's a pleasant experienceCons- Tuner seems to have problems pulling in stations that other hardware can aquire off the same antenna.- Caused hand shaking problems issues with HDMI CEC enabled devices. ---addressed with a CEC less cable- Occasionally hangs during channel changes (signal reception related?)- Gets confused with Station IDs in guide. --- Possibly fixed in firmware- Recorded the wrong program with the right name.  Recorded program was on different channel than specified. ---Possibly fixed in firmware- Had difficulties with updating the firmware over USB.- No antenna pass thru.General Interface And Use:Outside of all the problems, it's actually a great device.  I like the simplicity of the guide.  I like the ability to record all programs of the same name.  When the device works or is not keeping other devices from working, it's a good unit.Reception Issues:This unit was purchased to replace a SD DVR (Magnavox MDR533H).  The DVR+, like the unit before it had its own Mohu amplified indoor antenna facing the same direction and on the same wall as a identical Mohu unit attach to my TV (Samsung F8000).  The DVR+ failed to pull in 9 channels during an auto scan that both the F8000 and MDR533H picked up.  I had a Samsung ES7100 where the F8000 now sits and it had no difficulties pulling in all of same channels.  Swapping the antennas between the TV and DVR+ indicates the antennas are not the problem.  The F8000 still had 9 more channels than the DVR+ could detect.  I even removed power from antenna to see if the signal was too strong.  Nope. The tuners inside the DVR+ just aren't as good.  A manual scan only brought in 2 of the 9 missing channels.HDMI CEC:The DVR+ does not have HDMI CEC and caused problems with devices when HDMI CEC was enabled on them.  The DVR+ was first installed in the DVR port of my Pioneer VSX-822-K AVR.  I experienced issues with the HDMI standby and pass thru features not working and general switching problems.  Therefore, I installed the unit directly into the TV after reseting the units and the problems remained.  I upgraded to a new AVR (Sony STR-DN1050) and repeated the trials with the receiver and TV connections yet the handshaking, standby, and pass thru issues remained.  Only when I removed the DVR+ completely and reset all the HDMI devices did things return to normal.  I shouldn't have to choose between HDMI CEC being enabled and using the DVR+.  --- Made CEC less cable to address.  User states problem was fix in firmware update but Channel Master has neglected to answer my email regarding the issue so I can't confirm.Guide And Program Recording Issues:After adding a channel manually, it seems as if the DVR+ became confused about what stations were what.  In the program guide, Vudu moved from being on channel 200 to 65 (which is really Ion).  When tuning channels 200 and 65 were as they are supposed to be;  they were wrongly designated only in the guide.  This error I believe lead to the wrong program being recorded once.  The program to be recorded was set using the guide.  What was actually recorded was a program in the adjacent channel but it was named as if it was the one I selected.  ---- Firmware seems to have addressed.The DVR+ in my possession seems to be underachieving in its performance.  Watch this space for updates.  we'll see how Channel Master responds to these issues.  --- I received an automated message that my support request would be addressed in 24 hours but it has been 96+ hours.

Overall we are better off from a financial and reliability standpoint.  We live in a fringe area and do not get the numerous channels that some other locations do.  Our channel list says 27 channels, but some are duplicates and a few are of no use to us at all.  We do get all of the major network stations and that's what we want.  Some of the cable channels we watched, such as the History Channel, changed their type of programming so we don't need those anymore.I did pay to have a tech come out and install and sight our antenna.  I may or may not have been able to struggle  through that process, but it's tricky to get the sighting just right since there are at least 3 major transmitter directions.  We do need an outdoor antenna mounted on a pole on the roof.  There are no line-of-sight transmitters visible from our house.The only negatives for the DVR+ are that Rovi does not have data for all the channels, even some that are duplicates of the major networks.  I had a hard time getting the wifi dongle into the usb port on the dvr.  The usb from the ext. HD fit just fine.  It's really not a good idea to force the fit too much either.  Yes, I had it oriented correctly.  The first time I scanned in the channels, the weaker channel did not show up.  I downloaded and installed the most current firmware and re-scanned, getting the weak channel added.  It is still a little flaky though so we'll have to fine tune the antenna direction some more.  I see the newest version now has a built in 1tb hd and is $100 more.  I got a western digital 1tb hd from Amazon for $69.  If it crashes, it will be easy to replace.

The LED display is the best feature of this tool.  It's easy to read without being surface-of-the-sun bright and having two colors makes for easy at-a-glance readings.  Fantastic!Sadly, as a package, there are some glaring faults.First, it should have come with at least a single piece of paper that tells you what it is and what it is supposed to do so you can adjust your expectations accordingly but there was nothing but the unit in a plastic zip-lock bag.  Providing that information only on the Amazon page (which could disappear any time) is not a good substitute.  I did not remove any stars for this.Second, the (male) USB plug on the unit is the same that you would find on a USB-to-Ethernet adapter and will clearly not survive a lot of plug-unplug cycles.  For a piece of test equipment that will see a lot of handling, this is a problem.  Although a good technician or even a so-so one like myself could easily replace or repair it when it breaks, an average person could not so I deducted a star because of this.Third, the first two five star reviews were done by &#34;top reviewers&#34; who received units for test/evaluation.  It's just my opinion, but I think objectivity takes on a different hue when the reviewer has no skin in the game so I deducted a star.

I was also one of the early owner of first generation transformer pad.  The new keyboard, unlike the first generation keyboard with batter, has now no built-in batter to offer extended usage.  It's nice to still have a USB port on the left side.  The KitKat 4.4 is excellent but I won't focus on that.The keyboard dock is very secure and has a nice latching and two metal tab to secure the folding actions.  The release button is also very easy to operate.  However, if you don't push hard on dock, sometimes the tablet doesn't recognize it.My first impression is good.  But when I started to play streaming music off Amazon, I found out there's not a visible speaker port (hidden thru a meshed holes in the back) The music is hidden behind the pad (where it is loudest) and the music is louder if you place the pad facing down and the sound is a bit muffled.The screen glass is very smooth.  When typing with the keyboard, sometimes, the system is busy with updating app, it will miss a few characters.  I guess this is caused by the small amount of RAM (only 1 GB).  The unit is lighter than the previous generation (no more battery in the keyboard).  The bronze finish is not as exotic as before.  The performance is acceptable, considering the whole bundle is sub $300!!!The fact that some apps are default either in portrait or landscape is kind of difficult to use while docked.One last complaint is the battery charges really slowly if you are using it at the same time.

Unfortunately, this beauty is only skin deep - charging it involves some level of dis-assembly, and a worry about where to place the remaining parts of the stylus while it is charging.By default, the Pencil works as a spongy-tipped capacitive stylus - in any app, across all tablets, and even without being charged (since it does not use its Bluetooth radio.) Unfortunately, it is too expensive to be used in that mode.However, its true power (no pun intended) comes from its implementation of Bluetooth Low Energy (v4.0) which allow its more advanced features to be brought online. However, this does mean that it requires iPad versions that support this specification, namely the iPad 3 and later.When powered up, the Pencil/53 can actively detect when it is pressed (using buttons at both ends) and communicate that to the the iPad. This lets you use the Pencil/53 as naturally as you might use a real pencil (write with one end, and erase using the other.)The iPad-only Paper/53 app (2012 app of the year) is designed to engage the complete feature set of the Pencil/53 - it knows the difference between the writing tip and the eraser end (erase), your finger (blend mode), and your palm (palm rejection). The app also allows easy Bluetooth connection, without going in to the iPad settings menu (by touching and holding a connection icon in the tool palette.)Personally, I found that I quite enjoyed using this stylus - connection was quick, there was no lag, and its ratio of charge to use time was very decent. I also liked its ability to stick securely to my iPad. It took me a while to get comfortable with the carpenter's pencil-styling, but I got there eventually.The nib is very soft, and moves smoothly across my screen. This is a good thing because I had to remove my screen protector to get this to work, and it would have been tragic to have my screen scratched by this stylus. However, this extra softness means that you need to bear down on the stylus a bit, so the tip can wear itself out very quickly. I used mine for about two weeks before I noticed it wearing out. Fortunately, it comes with a replacement, but I'm now even more conscious about wear and tear on the nib.The design of Paper/Pencil comes from a team with a great track record (Xbox/Kinect) and has venture funding from Horowitz/Andreesen (Interestingly, I just completed reading Ben Horowitz's book &#34;The Hard Thing about Hard Things&#34;.)~A_E~", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A quality stylus", "unixReviewTime": 1402358400, "reviewTime": "06 10, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A28PVJGC8NAO6M", "asin": "B00JP12170", "reviewerName": "Frank R.

This is obviously going to make a difference depending on the person, but the size, shape, and construction materials feel great.Where the Pencil doesn't hold up is when comparing it to the Wacom Intuos Creative Stylus.

While the pencil works fine in the Paper app it works in none of the other major apps like Procreate.This means you also need to take into account the value of the Paper app, and it just isn't versatile enough to fill the needs that many who want pressure sensitive pens have. I'm not saying that Paper is a bad app. I use it all the time. It just doesn't do all that much with the pressure sensitivity provided by this pen. For the most part the app works the same as if you were using any stylus.I also prefer the buttons on the Wacom over the eraser on the Pencil. First, the buttons are programable in most apps. You can use them to erase, undo, redo, etc. Plus there are two of them.Add on that the Pencil is $30 more than the Wacom Bamboo Creative stylus right now and it is a no brainer to grab the Wacom. Hence why I think the Pencil is only worth three stars. Now, if I start seeing mass support of this stylus in other apps, or Paper adds a lot more features, then I will happily change my rating.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "A good pen that would be great if it worked with apps other than Paper", "unixReviewTime": 1403136000, "reviewTime": "06 19, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A1VQBEW0G4IH1J", "asin": "B00JP12170", "reviewerName": "J-J-J-Jinx!", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "I don't want to turn this into a review of Paper by 53, so I will just say about that app that I think it's good if you're willing to go along with what Paper wants you to do and not try to use it in some creatively different way. There is a promo video showing someone traveling and using Paper to draw images from their trip until they've filled up a whole virtual &#34;notebook&#34; in Paper, and then submitting the notebook to be printed into a real, physical book-ish thing, and that looks really cool, and if you want to do that it's a great idea. The problem comes when you just want to export the image...like if you wanted to doodle your ideas and then work on them further in another program later on your computer. Images export as .jpeg format and your options after that are going to be limited.Anyhoo...I'm kind of assuming you're not going to think about getting Pencil until you've tried Paper and decided it's fantastic or at least right for your needs. So in that case...This &#34;pencil&#34; feels really great in the hands. The graphite version isn't maybe as cool looking as the wood version but it has a nice weight and heft to it. I enjoyed drawing with it a lot, and I understand that it's not a pressure sensitive pen, which is something I WOULD like to try, but it's certainly possible to do quite a lot without pressure sensitivity and you may find you don't even think about it that much and just enjoy the different brushes.The packaging on this is very cool. I think it would make a great gift for anyone artistic. The battery lasts a long time and is easy to charge. I might give it five stars except I really want an oil painting brush and the most important thing: sometimes, even though the pencil is definitely showing as connected, the app thinks I'm using my finger for a stroke instead of the pencil (pretty sure that's what's happening) and I have to go back, undo, redo...it's a pain and gets in the way of flow.

J. Kwashnak \"voracious reader\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "53 PencilThe beauty of the iPhone and iPad is the use of touch as an input device.  Whether navigating apps, typing in notes or drawing with the various apps, touch provides a viable and superior method for input. While there are a number of apps out there for notes and drawing, one that consistently comes out at the top of reviewer lists is Paper by 53, a free app that lets you use a set of built in tools to capture and create artwork using your finger or a stylus. In order to improve upon the user experience, 53 has brought out their own stylus &#8211; the Pencil by Fifty Three. Different than most styluses you will find, this one has a wood like exterior but is shaped not like a cylinder but like a rectangular flat carpenter&#8217;s pencil. Five and a half inches long, the Pencil features a soft rubber pad at the top, and the bottom end tapers to a point, like in a pencil. The rubberized end conceals a standard stylus tip that allows you to input on the i-device and works with all screens and apps like any other stylus. Grab the tapered tip and pull, and the inside of the Pencil is revealed. Inside are circuits and a USB connector to charge the Pencil. Open up Paper and you&#8217;re ready to see the specialization of the Pencil. Turn on Bluetooth on your device, open Paper and go to a new page. On the toolbar, press and hold on the icon of the Pencil to &#8220;kiss&#8221; or pair the devices. Now you&#8217;re ready to rock. The program recognizes your Pencil and opens up a series of tools for you. Often when drawing our palm rests on the page (or the screen) but Pencil tells the program to ignore those touches. You choose your drawing tool and just draw with the Pencil.  Flip it over and you can use the rubber flat end to erase &#8211; no need to choose eraser from the toolbar. Use your finger for input instead of the Pencil and it activates the smudge function letting you blend edges. In all your efficiency really starts to grow.I&#8217;m not an artist, but I found that drawing with the Pencil to be comfortable. It has a very nice hand feel, better than most round styluses. The usage of the Bluetooth sensor freed me up from worrying about input from my hand on the screen, making it a lot easier to work with. I didn't find it necessarily any easier to write with on my drawing, but when trying to sketch or paint, it did a nicer job than other styluses I tried or my finger. The big downside is that the bells and whistles beyond a basic stylus is limited only to using Paper. If you use the app, then this is something you may find useful. The other main problem of course is the price. You have to decide you want to invest in this stylus and invest in using Paper.  I did find the extra tools to be great and makes the Pencil stylus very useful.  You can do a lot more with it than with you finger alone. If you have taken the time to work with the app, you will find this to be a very useful tool in your toolbox. If you are looking for something to take notes with for work or class, save your money and buy a general &#8220;dumb&#8221; stylus.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "If you use the Paper iOS drawing app, this is a very useful tool", "unixReviewTime": 1404950400, "reviewTime": "07 10, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A2UEB48LAWFUCW", "asin": "B00JP12170", "reviewerName": "Joseph \"jck09\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "Up to this point, I've been getting by with bargain iPad styli.

But it was a little erratic in sensing the difference between the tip, my finger, and the eraser. This isn't a huge problem, because the undo function in Paper is very easy, but still, it was distracting and made the experience less pleasant than ideal.

Truth be told, as much as Inateck's emulates Amazon cover's design, you will know and feel that your cover is a cheaper version of Amazon's original, especially when attempting to fold back the front cover as it constantly fights you, trying to revert to something close to an 'open book like' position which is not good.

Lee \"spamination\"", "helpful": [19, 20], "reviewText": "If you're like me, you've noticed a deluge of bluetooth speakers hitting the stores.  I've tried to listen to almost everyone of them, and I noticed a weird phenomenon.  The best speakers I've tested aren't from the big companies like Beats, Jawbone, or Bose.  The best bluetooth speakers are from relatively little-known companies with diminutive marketing budgets.  The best bluetooth speakers I've tested are from companies like UE(Ultimate Ears), House of Marley, and Sony--Sony being the only large company.  I've owned thousands of TDK products in my life--all of them being storage media (eg. Cr02 blank cassettes, CD-R and DVD-R).  I've never owned or thought to own an electronics product created by TDK.  Considering the trend, then this should be the best bluetooth speaker I've ever tested.  Let's find out.The first thing I noticed was just how small this speaker is.  It's a tad smaller than the Bose Soundlink III.  The second thing I noticed was how heavy this speaker is.  A lot of industrial engineering has been put to good use here.  The weight is very evenly distributed side-to-side and top-to-bottom.  This speaker feels like a high quality product the second you hold it.  Majority of the surface of the speaker is a thick metal grill that wraps around the front and back of the speakers.  The remainder of the speaker is a combination of piano-black edging and firm silicon.  The silicon is important for sealing the speaker from water.  This is a weather resistant speaker.  It's not rated for submersion, but it can handle the incidental raindrops and poolside splash.  On the top, there is a very efficient button-array.  There are the requisite bluetooth, power, and volume buttons.  Additionally, there is a phone button which makes answering calls very convenient.  The speaker performs very well as a speakerphone.  There are next and previous track buttons, as well as a pause/play button.  Pretty much every button you will need and nothing else.  This speaker additionally support NFC for easy syncing.  Just tap the back of your phone on the NFC label, and your phone or portable music player will link up with the speaker.  On the side, there is a usb (power only) port for charging devices.  It's not the 2.0 amps that I'd prefer, but it provides a serviceable 1.0 amps of current.  This isn't a gig though because 1 amp is plenty enough to maintain your phone's charge while streaming media.  There is also a 3.5mm jack for those who want to use a cable for connecting to this speaker.  Before I go into the sound quality, I wanted to cover a couple of other quick specifications.  The first is that this speaker only supports bluetooth 2.1.  I'd prefer bluetooth 4.0 for the energy efficiency or bluetooth 3.0 for the larger bandwidth, but the implementation of bluetooth 2.1 does not adversely effect the performance of this speaker--in terms of both sound and battery life.  This speaker lasts about 8 hours on battery,  and the volume is not throttled down when running on battery like many other devices I've tested.  To sum up the looks and specs, this speaker has pretty much everything you need and nothing you don't in a very small and high-quality package.The sound is where this speaker just floored me.  First off, this speaker is LOUD, and as I mentioned during my rundown of the specs, the volume does not throttle on battery.  The speaker is ridiculously loud whether on battery or plugged into an outlet.  Not only is this speaker ridiculously loud, but the sound also travels.  Not just the highs or just the lows, but the entire sound spectrum travels, so if you are in a large open area, this speaker will fill the space with ease.  Although not truly omni-directional, this speaker does provide good sound all around the speaker.  This speaker uses three separate drivers.  Two subwoofers for the lows, and one multi-gradient driver for the mids and highs.  The two bass exhausts are located on the back-side of the speaker.  So now that I've covered the quantity of sound, let's examine the quality of sound.  Prior to getting my hands on the TDK TREK, my three favorite bluetooth speakers were the UE Boom, House of Marley Get Together, and the Sony SRSX7.  I am not a huge fan of Bose, Jawbone or Beats speakers.  Bose is the best of these overpriced marketing baubles, and the Soundlink III is a vast improvement over the Soundlink II, but I find my three favorites to far exceed the Bose speakers in value and in performance.  I won't even go into what I think of Jawbone and Beats.  So where does this TDK fit in?  Well, I'm happy to report that this is, in my opinion, the new king of sound in the bluetooth speaker market.  Everything is there: the highs are crystal, the mids are rich, and the bass is thumping.  This speaker is beautifully tuned, and the sound integrity is maintained at all volumes.  No distortion was audible even at maximum volume.  Every song I throw at it sounds good--classic rock, classical, modern rock, pop, hip-hop.  It really is remarkable how such a rich and powerful sound emanates from such a small device.  Simply sublime.So let's wrap this up.  We have here a speaker that lasts 8 hours on battery, is weatherproof, has all the necessary features, sounds better than any bluetooth speaker out there, and comes in a slick ultra-portable form factor.  What am I forgetting?  Oh yeah, and it's currently selling for half the price of its more expensive rivals.  If you are even thinking about buying a bluetooth speaker, give this a go.  With this speaker, you can have your cake and eat it too.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "AMAZING!", "unixReviewTime": 1404259200, "reviewTime": "07 2, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A1PI8VBCXXSGC7", "asin": "B00JTDAXDI", "reviewerName": "Lynn", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "Lepow battery banks always impress me with their classy, sleek designs...and they function as advertised too.TheLepow Simplicity 7800mAh High Capacity Lithium Ion External Batteryis another Lepow battery pack with a unique & sleek design. Its large 7800mAh capacity will fully charge an iPhone several times.I charged a Kindle Fire HD (1st gen) & a Fire HDX when they  both had about 50% power left. The Simplicity charged them both to 100% & had power left.It has a 90% conversion rate which means the Simplicity @ 7800mAh, 90% conversion, will provide more charges than a 7800mAh with a 70 - 80% conversion. (You will receive closer to the 7800mAh charging capacity. I hope that makes sense, it's hard for me to explain)One time, my Fire HDX was at 14% - in an 1h 20m, the Simplicity had the HDX battery charged to  62%...that was fast! The Simplicity's output is 2.1A.Fully charge before first use.To check for battery life,  press the power button, the 4 LED lights  will indicate the remaining battery level in the portable charger. It will need to be recharged if no LEDs are lit. I usually recharge it when only one LED lights up.Charge the Simplicity by plugging the micro USB into the Simplicity & the USB into your laptop or AC USB Wall Charger (recommended for faster charging).When the Simplicity is charging, the LED light/s will start blinking. When it is full, all four lights will appear solid.When the Simplicity was depleted & needed to be recharged, it took about 7 - 7 1/2 hours to fully charge it using an AC wall charger.I absolutely love the wrap around micro USB cable. It is so convenient & doesn't come off in my purse.If you use the Simplicity with an Apple product or a product that doesn't use a micro USB, you will need to supply your own cable.Safety Features: The intelligent circuit prevents the battery from self-charging when the micro USB is plugged into both ports. Automatic temperature control to protect the battery against electrical hazards to protect the phone's battery.Lepow thinks of everything, they even use direct color injection molding (reduces the spraying process) which is more eco friendly.

This laptop is fast for watching YouTube, going on Amazon, and overall fast on the internet. One thing that really bummed me out on this thing is it only having ONE ram slot. That means at most only 8 GB can be installed on this thing. I really do enjoy the texture on it and the touch screen its very handy when it comes to using windows 8. Honestly if your PC (laptop or desktop) dont have a touch screen I think windows 8 is useless. Without a touch screen it makes it harder to get around in the operating system, just trying to use the \"charms bar\" is a pain with the mouse and keyboard. You can get to the charms bar by pressing the windows key and C but I wouldnt want to do that all the time just to bring up the charms bar. Windows 8 on this laptop functions pretty well. Its snappy when it comes to booting up and loading programs and fun to use for the most part. I think in general windows 7 is better set up, the overall layout is attractive and built more towards using a keyboard and mouse. Windows 7 I think is more organized than Windows 8. In Windows 8 you have to swipe up to see ALL your programs and keep on swiping to the left to get to that one program you want to use whereas in Windows 7 you click the start button to see all your programs and they are all right there in folders. You click on the folder your program is in and its right there. You dont have to swipe 3 or 4 times looking at every single program just to find that one thing you want. In Windows 8 your programs are all categorized either by name, date installed, most used or by category. I also dont like how they try to simplify things like the weather app how its just a circle with lines. It looks childish and unsophisticated. They could of taken the time to make it look better. Windows 8 is a little glitchy sometimes but it has only been out for about a year and a half so that is understandable. It sometimes randomly switches me to different apps when I am on my desktop. I dont hate windows 8 at all I just think Microsoft could of done better. Maybe if Microsoft would of made a desktop version of Windows 8 and a tablet version. Putting back the start button in on the desktop and laptop versions and maybe making Windows 8 more graphical. I really did enjoy the windows being transparent in the Windows 7 operating system.I hope this is at least somewhat helpful and please forgive me for any grammar errors or miss spellings.Spelling is not at all my strong suit LOL", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Not a bad laptop", "unixReviewTime": 1400284800, "reviewTime": "05 17, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "AQ2FC1DLKVD8H", "asin": "B00JTU88Y2", "reviewerName": "P.

They are so lightweight, with soft ear padding, that they feel comfortable for hours.  They don't hurt my ears from their weight pressing down.

I'd even go so far as to say that these seem like the best option for women who want this style since so many other brands seem designed for larger heads and ears.The sound quality is pretty darn good, too.  No hiss.  A good balance of bass and treble. Clear vocals. Like others that fit this way, they does lose some quality and volume because they don't press firmly against the ear; however, this is how ear-looping headphones work.  The Bluetooth range for my iPhone is only 10 feet or so, but I've learned that's a limitation of the phone, since the range with my iPad is closer to the standard 33 feet.Once I discovered that the fit, comfort, and sound quality were up-to-par, I found other things to love about these.  When not in use, they automatically curl up into a palm-size circle.  Because the behind-the-head piece doesn't stick out, I can lean back in my chair without popping the headphones off my ears.

There is a safty factor too: they do not totally block ambient noise, so I can hear approaching cars behind me when I am on a walk. The isolating in-ear monitors that I normally use so completely blocked out everything that I was in my own world on walks and drifted into a few unsafe situations.The sound quality is such that you can easily hear high, mid and low range frequencies in most music. I listen to acoustic jazz circa 1950s and these do an excellent job for that style.An interesting observation is during my testing I paired and connected with these, put them through their paces and then paired and connected to another bluetooth device that I was checking out. These remained connected after I established a connection to the other device and I was able to stream music to both simultaneously. That leads me to conclude that two people could listen to the same music stream if each had a pair of these phones.

This was one of the best birthday presents I've ever received and I have the Vine program to thank for this gift.  This computer is just beyond anything I've ever owned, and I literally have built my own machines from scratch, owned and fixed many laptops, etc;. Alienware tops them all.If you're a fan of the show 24:Live Another Day and its resident hacker Chloe O'Brian, then you know that Alienware is the computer brand that Chloe uses as a communications unit within the show to help out Jack Bauer.The chassis is well-built with a magnesium-alloy. There are lights on both sides and the back of the machine that light up crystal blue, along with the &#34;ALIENWARE&#34; logo below the laptop screen. I thought when I first received this machine that I would be limited to the color blue for the light scheme. I was blown away to know that you can change the color scheme on a whim with the Alienware Command Center (under the option Alienware FX). It's beyond awesome. I created my own color theme with the center, changing the light scheme on the side from a dark blue to a hot pink, and the lighting scheme with for the keyboard now has a sunset gradient that I've created from scratch. You can also change up the lighting for the power buttons, mouse and the back of the monitor. I love to have a machine that is not only beautiful, but practical (allowing me to program), without having to necessarily use a MAC, and ALIENWARE does that.I love that it also uses the Windows 7 Operating System, rather than Windows 8, which I don't care for, and is on the other laptop I recently purchased last year. The machine has two earphone ports for gamers. It has an SD-RAM slot above the DVD ROM slot. It also has four USB ports. I had a little problem with the USB ports recognizing some of my portable devices, however, including my Seagate Hard Drives and my Kindle device.The hard drive is also 1 TB, enough room to put whatever stuff you like on your machine. I plan to repartition mine to eventually place a second operating system on it (LINUX) and have it be a dual booting machine in the future. But, I think if you have these gaming machines made, there is a way to request LINUX be added as an O/S on your machine too.The sound system was another plus for me. The Klipstch speakers have Dolby Surround Sound, and produce quality sound for music and videos. I could finally ditch my plug-in speakers that I used for my old laptop.

Pink Floyd also sounded pretty good with average bass or less.  Richard Thompson probably sounded the worst, as he's got a pretty deep voice to begin with, I had to turn the bass down quite a bit.

If you are using a different operating system you will need to experiment with the top row and function key combinations.It is technically a mechanical keyboard because of the nested plunger style mechanism under the keys. The key press required to activate a key has a little more travel than I am accustomed to, but I have been typing on laptop keyboards for so long that I have forgotten what a real keyboard feels like. In fact it took me a few hours to get use to the expansive real estate of this one.The key feel is very similar to other gaming keyboards that use the Cherry MX Black switches. The actual mechanism is different from the Cherry MX Black, but the feel and sound are near identical. One of the things that I love about this keyboard is the sculpted keys that remind me of those on a vintage IBM Selectric typewriter (I am definitely revealing my age.) The feel is nowhere near the same with respect to tactile feedback and that satisfying clack, but the key faces are darn close.I tested the function keys and the one marked mail invoked Outlook Express on my system, and one with the headphones icon (Function + F1) brought up Windows Media Player. Those apps were already associated in my operating system settings.While the instruction sheet is in Chinese, it was also graphical and displayed the key mappings. Although those are obvious anyway I hope that the company will ship English instructions to the US market. This is not an issue for me, but is an oversight that needs to be rectified.One thing that is cool is you can change the backlight of the keys from blue to red to pink. Or you can turn it off completely it it bothers you.While this is designed to work with Windows systems I did test it out on myKeedox Quad Core RK3188 Android 4.2 1080P 5G 2.4G HDMI Bluetooth 4.0 Smart TV BOX Network Media Playerand it worked perfectly as a keyboard. I am still exploring the mappings of the function keys.Overall this is an exceptionally well made keyboard that feels great (now that I have reacquainted myself with full size keyboards.)

They have really thoughtfully designed products that in many ways supplement and even enhance the usability of your mobile devices. This Galaxy Tab 4 keyboard/case combo is a perfect example of that high level style.The case is extremely well built and well designed. Galaxy Tab 4 slips into it easily, and it fits very snugly. The case is very sturdy and it gives your tablet quite a bit of protection. The case has a built in kickstand that allows you to angle the tablet under a variety of angles. Unlike some other kickstands that I&#8217;ve seen, this one designed in such a way that it allows you to use your tablet on your lap for typing. Even though this is a very light case relatively speaking, it will still add quite a bit of bulk to your Galaxy Tab. If you intend to use your Tab as a laptop replacement though, that might not be a very noticeable issue.The keyboard synced via Bluetooth with Galaxy Tab. The whole process was very smooth and quick. While it&#8217;s turned on the keyboard stays in touch with the tablet at all times, sometimes that is not always the case with the inferior wireless keyboards.The keyboard uses rechargeable batteries, and it can be charged through a USB cable. The keyboard will last you a several days to a few weeks, or even a month, on a single charge, depending on how much you use it. It takes about two to three hours to get it fully charged.One major shortcoming of this keyboard is its cramped size. This, of course, is not Logitech's fault, as it&#8217;s impossible to have the full keyboard functionality that fits a 10&#8221; device. The smaller keyboard is suitable enough for most short writing tasks, such as composing emails and shorter documents, but I would not rely on it for, say, writing of a Ph.D. thesis. The key action, however, is really good and it&#8217;s one of the best ones I&#8217;ve seen on any keyboard. It makes typing on such a cramped space much more tolerable.Another annoying thing for me is that there doesn&#8217;t seem to be much standardization when it comes to tablet sizes (and the appropriate cases) out there right now. Each tablet manufacturer has its own design that is different just enough from all the other ones on the market that it requires a complete overhaul of any of the accessories. It&#8217;s even more annoying that manufacturers even have very different designs for their own line of tablets, with changes from one generation to the next that sacrifice compatibility and functionality in pursuit of some aesthetical agenda. And then there is Samsung, with two different lines of tablets (Tab and Note) with incompatible sizes and ports. It forces you to completely revamp your whole accessory collection every time you upgrade your tablet, at not an insignificant price. I truly wish that at least the keyboard/case manufacturers would come up with designs that are more universal. I understand that it&#8217;s impossible for them to know the direction that the tablet manufacturers would take in advance, but the least they can do is make the cases/keyboards backward compatible with the previous generation of devices.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Well Built and Practical", "unixReviewTime": 1403827200, "reviewTime": "06 27, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A2KKQ2K4O2GY2Y", "asin": "B00JZM7T2Q", "reviewerName": "Sonja", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "Logitech doesn't make a keyboard for the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014, and I happen to like the layout of Logitech's keyboards, so I got this same keyboard folio made by Logitech for the Galaxy Tab 3.

For some reason there is no picture of the back, but it is the same as is pictured on the pages for the lower priced models, with the additional 6 USB ports, room for 3 expansion cards and a little brace that acts as a plug protector.I'm using the same video card in another computer. It has a lot of bang for the buck. I have folders with 1000's of images and the thumbnails display immediately for all of them. This Dell handles all my CorelDraw files as well as can be expected when using an old program on a new operating system. Data is saved to the hard drive very fast. The disk drive is not very noisy. It all works great.The Windows 8.1 takes about twice as long to boot as 8.0, about 25 seconds instead of 12. I don't know if that is because of Windows or Dell. It's still faster than 7.0.

I am not a computer expert, but a knowledgeable user having used laptops, tablets, and desktops. I have always used Windows software with the recent exception of Android tablets.  This is my second experience with Windows 8 and I realize there is a lot of controversy over this relatively new operating system.The specifications for this laptop are a 15.6\" non-touch HD screen, a 4th generation i7-4510u Intel processor with 8gb ram expandable to 16gb ram, and an integrated Intel HD 4400 graphics processor.  There is no DVD drive with this model. There are 2 USB 3.0 ports and one USB 2.0 port as well as a full size HDMI port. It has an ethernet port, headphone jack, and a SD card reader. This model has a backlit keyboard, full integrated numeric keypad, webcam, Wifi and Bluetooth.The fit and finish of this Dell laptop are top quality plastics and aluminum yielding a weight of about 6 lbs. and an inch thick at the hinge. Not the lightest nor the thinnest laptop available, but certainly for the price, it is competitive.Last night I watched a show on HBOGo streaming video and there was no lag or buffering at all and the HD screen was clear, bright with excellent contrast.I do believe that if you are going to benefit from Windows 8, you need a touch screen, or use the Classic windows theme and desktop.  Like buying a car, you first determine how much you want to spend, then look for a model you like that you can afford.  Same with laptops.  Do you need a disc drive? Touchscreen? Will you do gaming? Work or home use? There are many variables.  Personally, I prefer a desktop, but the portability of a laptop is certainly undeniable.  Tablets and smartphones are ultra-portable.  Depends how you want to compute and connect.  I find value in all the venues.  I have bought 3 Dell desktops in the past, and they have all served me well, in fact, I am typing this review on a 6 year old Dell desktop.This Dell laptop has competition from HP, Sony, Acer, Toshiba and others with similar specs.  Personally, I trust Dell, look for good deals on them and have always gotten my money's worth.  I must say doing research on this particular model was not easily forthcoming as Dell has so very many configurations. I did find it strange that Dell used this very new processor with only dual cores instead of the newer standard four core processors.If you're looking for a middle market priced laptop with a newer processor, this Dell should give you years of use, and should be able to process most anything you can throw at it, with the limitation of some graphic intensive games.  Buying a new laptop is very similar to buying a new car - if you don't know what you're doing, ask someone who does.  Recommended.UPDATE: After using this laptop for a few weeks, I really like it.  I have connected it to my TV via HDMI cable and watched some movies and TV shows. Worked great.  I like the backlit keyboard very much as it really helps in my dimly lit den.  One thing about the screen. You have to adjust the viewing angle to get the picture perfect because when not correct the screen can be difficult to see and loses it nearly perfect clarity and sharpness.  It's not a big deal, but worth noting. Side to side viewing angles are acceptable.  This is very well made, feels substanial and the case doesn't show fingerprints.

I have had a previous model of the Dell Inspiron issued to me by my employer about 4 years ago, so I have previous experience with Dell, mostly positive. I feel a slight responsibility to admit that I prefer Macs, but my preferences will not bias my review of the performance of this machine. There may be some comparisons, but only as it affects my assessment of performance of this laptop. Having no other PC's in the house, this is the best I can do.As stated above, I wanted a new laptop to replace my aging one, although I thought the price of this one a bit high in the PC market. However, it is much cheaper than a new MacBook Pro. (And certainly, through the vine program, absolutely cost-free!).The 1.7 GHz Intel Core i5 processor (with turbo boost) should have been plenty of power to meet my needs. Sadly, my 2.0GHz speed on my old MacBook loads pages faster. The WIFI connection is really poor on this computer and constantly drops connections and won't load pages even when the indicator shows four or a full load of bars. Social media sites time out, and YouTube is a buffering nightmare. The placement in my living room is exactly the same as my 7 year old laptop and all my mobile devices. My iPhone, iPod, my spouse's MacBook Pro, and two iPads load fine there, and swiftly. The Dell loads much faster when I am in the office where the router is located, but the purpose of having a laptop is defeated if I am only 10 feet away from my desktop. You Tube still does not load well, even there.What's up with this price, on a laptop that is weak and unimpressive? Granted, it does boast of a touch screen, but really, how practical is it on a laptop? You are not going to word process on this touchscreen. Although useful for accessing links immediately,  this laptop touchscreen will not compete with a tablet.The battery drains quickly. It boasts of a six and a half hour battery life, but I would be surprised if you get three and a half to four hours.  The laptop comes with a trial of MS word. (My product key will not of course work, since mine is for Mac).So far, the focus has been on the negative. There are positives as well. This laptop is very attractive. The brushed metal top looks very nice and fingerprints do not show. The lack of an optical drive makes it light, and adding an external is really not a problem. I'm still learning the multi-function touch pad, but once I figure it out, I should get better control over what I actually want as opposed to what I am getting. There is no operating manual, only a quick start guide that basically says, \"Plug it in and turn it on\". The screen is also a positive feature. It appears bigger than it actually is, and the resolution is very clear.The remainder of my gripes are related to Windows 8, so I won't go there. I knew XP pretty well, and Windows 8 seems buggy and more complicated than necessary, and even counter-intuitive at times. That, of course, has nothing to do with the laptop's performance, and will not count against it in my overall appraisal.In summary, I'm not terribly impressed with this laptop. I could give it higher marks if the WIFI was not so inconsistent and weightier websites would load faster, or even load at all. Streaming video is also a significant problem that does not exist in my other devices and laptops. If these are concerns you may have, I would keep looking.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Not terribly impressed", "unixReviewTime": 1404432000, "reviewTime": "07 4, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A1501C38OCSEMA", "asin": "B00K4PATR0", "reviewerName": "Literary Wonders! \"Literary Wonders!\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "I would give this laptop a 4 1/2 stars, but since Amazon only allows whole numbers I have to steer to the 4 start mark. This was a good product for the most part.Out the box there were no real instructions or manual to help with set up. In addition, there was no additional software included with this laptop. In most cases, when you purchase a new computer or laptop, there is a software package that comes with it. This was not the case for this Dell Laptop. it did come with a 30-day free trial of Microsoft Office 2013, but this is something anyone can get by downloading from the Microsoft site. It also came with a 30-Day-McAfee trial. Thank God I have Norton multi-device software.The screen is large and I actually have to say that I use the laptop now more than my desk top.It has 3 USB ports which makes it easy to attach a mouse, external storage drive and an additional USB item.The sound on this laptop without headphones or speakers leaves much to be desired. However, when you input headphones or a desktop speaker system, the sound on this toy is incredible.It is a bit heavy (for me), but I like that I can work anywhere I want and not be stuck to my desk.I mentioned that the screen was big, 17 inches. It has tons of memory and internal hard drive space.I like that this laptop has a 10 key, keypad to the left. I use Photoshop a lot and this helps when putting in code.I've only  had this laptop for about three weeks now and during the 1st week, the battery life was awesome, now I am finding that the battery doesn't hold a charge like it used to.If I had to pick ONE thing I don't like about this laptop is the the mouse/pad. I type 100 wpm without looking at the keyboard and this particular board does not have raised left and right mouse buttons.

It installs easily ( I didn't use the software) and is pre-paired between the mouse and the wireless receiver (which is housed in the mouse bay by the batteries).There is one aspect that can be seen as a positive or a negative: The mouse is extremely light weight, especially for a full sized mouse. I often prefer one that is a bit heavier, but I can see where this could be really good for people with wrist issues or who cannot move around much weight on the desk. That's personal preference.The second item is also per-person: My right fingers don't want to lie right where they've designed for them to go. I don't chock this up to a design issue, but to the fact that I'm used to using mobile mice all the time, and somewhat stopped using desktop mice.Overall, usage was accurate, with no wireless stutters or issues, and the mouse was quite reliable.

My initial impression, after just completing my review of the impressiveOlympus WS-821 Voice Recorderand even more impressiveOlympus DM-901 Voice Recorders, was that this unit would not do well at all.  Then I discovered two features that, depending on how you want to use it, makes this recorder far more valuable than the other two.The two features are:- This recorder can record, even at the highest quality setting, for a very, very long time.  The listing claims 70 hours and in my test, it recorded nonstop for 64 hours.- The built in stereo microphone is pretty darn good.  It captures sound very well.  I tried a good quality external microphone and didn't hear any improvement.The listing calls it a \"spy\" microphone, implying you can leave it somewhere, capture audio surreptitiously, and retrieve it later.  It will do that and I found an even better use for it; as an always-on life monitor.The problem with those other little recorders is they only record for so long.  If you leave them on there's a good chance the battery will run down during the day.  If you are like me, you'll never be quick enough or perhaps won't remember to pull it out when something comes up that I want to record.With this recorder, I hit \"Record\" on Friday morning and dropped it into my pocket.  It recorded everything that happened including some clever remarks by my daughter, a five-hour business meeting, a couple phone numbers that were told to me, saying goodbye to my wife on Saturday at the airport as she left for a business trip, all the things she told me to do while she was away, more clever remarks from my daughter the next morning... you get the idea.  It's a hand's off memory that captures everything.  Conveniently, the captured audio is broken into settable segments; I picked 60-minute chunks.All I have to do is connect the recorder with the included (or any other standard) micro-USB cable and drag the files to my PC.  They are named by the recording time and day plus a sequential number.  The file creation date tells me when they were recorded.  From there it's easy to zero in on the things I want to recall.Also included in the package is an external mic with a long cord, and a telephone recorder adapter complete with patch cables.  The external mic is not included to provide better audio quality (it makes it somewhat worse).  It is there so you can hide the recorder out of the way, like under some sofa cushions and snake the mic to a somewhat more exposed spot.  The telephone recorder adapter is not a high value item, looking very much like theTelephone Recording Adapter for Digital Voice Recorder.  Still, it's nice to have it tossed in.What isn't included is any software to play, edit, or enhance the audio.  That's OK.  There is a program called audacity (easily found via Google) that is free and worth many times that.  I used it for many years and it can do wonders to enhance audio if needed.One final thought - This recorder includes my favorite DVR feature, the ability to set a \"record start time\" and \"end time\".  You do that, put the recorder on \"Hold\" and can depend on it capturing the segment  selected.  At least, that used to be my favorite feature.  With this recorder I don't bother with any of that.  All I do is hit record and put it on hold.  Unless the thing I want to record is several days away it will be certain to capture what I want along with other interesting stuff that I hadn't anticipated.Bottom line: If you are looking for a \"fancy\" recorder then perhaps consider the options I listed at the top of this review.  However, if you want something that can capture everything said in your presence at the press of a single button for several days running then this little recorder could easily fit the bill.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "While other small recorders can be in your pocket ready to record, this one can be there always recording!", "unixReviewTime": 1401667200, "reviewTime": "06 2, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "ATQ94BNMBU6ZN", "asin": "B00K73NSU4", "reviewerName": "D.

It's a technological marvel.But, after using the camera for just a brief time, I realized that I just cannot live with the immensely small (2.9x) zoom.  It's even less than the last version.  As good as this camera is and as spectacular as the image quality ends up being, the camera is just not practical for me without more optical zoom.  It barely zooms which essentially means you have to be right up on your subject which, for me, means missing out on many shots.I get that Sony made tradeoffs to get such stellar picture quality in such a form factor and my hats off to them for their remarkable advances.  But, for me, I realized after using the camera briefly that I'd happily trade slightly less quality for much longer range.

Half pressing the shutter button will correct the issue... sometimes.2) \"Intelligent Auto\" shooting mode is not a dependable mode to leave the camera in.a. It ALWAYS uses the \"Wide\" \"Focus Area\" in this mode (see con #1).b. Scene recognition frequently selects the wrong scene. Taking an image of a car passing at 25 miles per hour results in a blurred streak.3) When the \"Center\" \"Focus Area\" setting is selected, images still lack sharpness when compared to a Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3 from 2009.4) Colors are dull, especially when compared to images taken by a Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3 from 2009.5) Auto white balance (AWB) sometimes produces shots that are too warm.a. If two shots are taken back-to-back sometimes one will be warm and the other accurate.6) In a space the size of a living room, using a flash at distance frequently results in overexposure.7) When shooting handheld, it's difficult to maintain the proper grip and use the control ring due to the size of the camera and lack of an actual grip.8) The screen is cluttered with an excessive amount of icons that cannot be individually shown/hidden.

Simply unneeded: SteadyShotSummary:There are several pros when it comes to the RX100 III but they seem to center around physical camera interaction and less frequent uses such as, low light and video. When it comes to daylight photos, which is a very frequent camera use, the bottom line is that pictures are not sharp enough or rich enough in color.

I owned the Fuji x100s for about a year before I sold it.  Not becuase I didn't like it, because I did, but because it was simply too big to fit in my pocket and its weird in camera rendering to skin tones when the iso increased.  I also still own a Nikon D800 and D600 but needed something for every day photo's with family and just for fun.  This camera on paper is perfect.  Size, large aperture, 24-70mm equivalent, image stabalized AND has a revolutionary built in EVF.  When it arrived the first thing I noticed was how compact it really is.  It is a tiny camera even if the previous generations are small as well.  It seems very solid (except the popout flash which feels like I'm going to break it every time I push it back in) for being so small but at the same time there is so much packed into a tiny space I'm constantly worried I'm going to break something.  I guess that's what I get when I go from 2 full frame DSLR's to a pocket cam for travel.  Nonetheless this is a technological marvel.  My favorite feature, that incredible rotating LCD.  Awesome.  I shoot weddings with pro-level DSLR's and I can't tell you how much I appreciate the rotating LCD!  The fact I can flip it around 180 degress to take a picture with my wife and then rotate it to 45 degrees down to shoot over my head is so useful I can't recommend it enough.  We've taken more pics together since getting this camera than in the past year simply because it is easy to do.  The viewfinder is very neat but to be honest I haven't found a situation where I've wanted to use it yet (that doesn't mean that I won't but I haven't as of yet).  The image quality, in terms of focus and clarity, is excellent.  The low light results have been reasonably good up to about 1600 iso and I allow it to go up to 3200 iso sometimes if I really need a shot.  This is impressive for a camera with a sensor this small.  Now I have to mention my number one issue with this camera and the reason it gets a 4 instead of a 5 from me.....Auto White Balance.  I don't know why but every sony camera I've ever used has substantially cooler white balance than any other brand I've used.  This comes across as a slightly blue and green tint in photos.  Maybe the average consumer won't notice but I look at images all the time when I edit for weddings and these colors are off.  I know I can set multiple manual white balances with this camera but my purpose in getting this was to have a small camera for everyday use that I can shoot JPEG's with in aperture priority and have no editing to do in post.  The Auto White Balancing is, in my opinion, terrible.  My old fuji rendered significantly more accurate colors straight out of camera.  I plan to play around with the camera to see if I can globally adjust the auto white balance to a level I'm comfortable with.  If sony reads these I would encourage them to examine their AWB outputs vs the competition and release a firmware update that at least offers a second \"auto\" setting to warm up the tones across the board.  I hate to harp so much on this as the camera itself is excellent.  Hopefully I can find a way to make it work as I don't want to return the camera.  If you have a lot of experience with these cameras and know of a solution for me, I am open to input from the community as well!  The only other con to this camera is the On/Off button.  I don't know why they insisted on this being a button.  A switch would have made this a non-issue.  I accidentally turn this thing on frequently while sliding it into my pocket.  This is a scary thing to do as the lens shoots out as soon as the power goes on.  When this happens you are greeted with the unpleasant sound of the motor griding to push the lens out through your pocket.  I have to be very careful when holding the camera as you barely have to press the button to activate the power.In conclusion, fantastic small camera with some small issues.  Definitely the best pocket camera out there.  If you prefer cool tones in your images this is a no brainer.  If you prefer more realistic tones, I'll post an update if I find a way to get this thing to warm up.UPDATE: So if you don't mind shooting in the Auto modes then there is a pretty good solution.  If you click down on the rear dial it brings up a simple settings menu.  On that menu is a temperature adjustment that lets you warm up the image to your liking.  The downside is that it resets everytime you turn the camer off.  Also, that simple menu is only available under the auto modes and does not activate under the A,S or M modes.  For me, this is a good enough answer as my usage of this camera is primarily in auto mode (if I want a highly technical photo I'll probably use my D800).  No doubt this camera can do great things and has very versatile raw files but I have no desire to edit these files and it is meant to be a quick fix when I want a picture:)  I'm still not giving it 5 stars because the power button is way to easy to activate and that annoys me to no end.  Despite my feelings about the AWB and power button, this is the absolute best pocketable camera on the market by a landslide.  Nothing on the market comes close to the image quality that can still fit in your pocket.  It will not disapoint in that regard.So all said, this camera is awesome (don't sweat the small stuff).  Sony has leapfrogged the competition and I don't see any of the competitors beating this camera unless the Fuji X30 gets a 1\" sensor as well at Photokina this year and is able to maintain the size and speed of the rx100 iii.  I honestly doubt that will happen though.  Sony's improvements have been pretty awesome and I can't wait to see what they do when they have mastered their lens element fusing technique used in the rx100 iii.  Perhaps an even faster lens in the same size or maybe even an APSC sensor in a pocketable body!  Wouldn't that be awesome!  If you want a portable camera that won't let you down, this is the only game in town right now.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Excellent update to a great camera, loses a star for the dreaded Sony AWB (auto white balance)", "unixReviewTime": 1403481600, "reviewTime": "06 23, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A1I3QMX3VN9RLC", "asin": "B00K7O2DJU", "reviewerName": "HD_Dude", "helpful": [5, 5], "reviewText": "Recently I went on a week-long college tour with my daughter.

I adore the D800, but this was an on-your-feet, strolling in and out of buildings, across quads, and past athletic fields for hours at a time kind of day.So I bought the RX100M3. Fits right in my pants pocket. Not jeans, but khakis. I'd forget it was there, until I wanted a shot. Then I'd pull it out, get the shot, and tuck it away again.Plenty of battery life, so I had enough juice for multiple college visits in one day. Including the 'scene setter' shots of the towns they were located in.At the end of the day, the image quality was excellent. Just plain excellent. It handled a variety of mixed-lighting shots, landscapes, lecture halls, dorm rooms, architecture, and interiors.My D800 would probably have done better.

I also own a Canon 5D Mk III and a Leica M9, but the great truism is that your photo is only as good as the camera you happen to have with you. Hence a lot of photos today are taken using smartphones and every one of them is better than the photo you would never have taken if you didn't have a camera in hand!The RX 100 is arguably the best compact camera on the market, on balance. And the Mk III outshines its predecessors in the following ways:* The effective image quality is improved. It uses exactly the same sensor as the Mk II but it has a stop or more advantage as you zoom in and that simply means that a photo that would have been captured at, say, 400 ISO is now captured at 200 ISO. (The lower the ISO the less noise). Richard from Boston, respectfully: all three versions have the same F1.8 lens at the widest focal length. It is as you zoom that the maximum F stop decreases: from F4.9 in the prior versions at 100mm (35mm equivalent) focal length, to F2.8 in the current version but at a maximum focal length of only 70mm.* The zoom range is reduced but extended at the wide angle end: 24mm-70mm (35mm equivalent) from 28mm-100mm in the prior versions. This is a big plus for me but maybe less so for others. I used to use Panasonic/Leica LX compacts (same friggin' camera but you pay at least 2X for the Leica label and Leica's product design - the plastic casing - is more than 2x better than Panasonic's) that had a 24mm-90mm (F1.4-F2.8) lens and I really missed the 24mm widest angle when I moved to Sony. So, why did it take so long for Sony to catch up with Panasonic? Fact is, Sony's sensor is much, much bigger than Panasonic's. This translates to superior performance, but makes it much harder to make bright zoom lenses for such a compact camera. (Consider how large lenses are on a DSLR.)* The EVF is fantastic. I've been using SLRs for 50 years, literally, and the greatest advantage to a viewfinder in my opinion is that it anchors the camera to your face and you end up with a more stable camera and a lower required shutter speed which translates into a lower ISO and better image quality.  This EVF is 'only' 1.44 megapixels, versus 2.44 in their higher end cameras, but both look absolutely 'real' (as if you were looking through an optical viewfinder for the most part with the larger pixel space simply 'looking' larger through the view finder.)Other advantages include a better menu structure and a dedicated flash on button - which is a big deal from my POV. Also a rear screen that can flip up completely for selfies.Any way you look at it, the Sony RX-100 is a fantastic camera in any version, but the Mk III is the most impressive.Bravo, Sony!PS: all there versions have a pivoting flash that allows one to bounce the flash off a ceiling. The results are so much better than direct flash. It really delivers vastly superior flash photos assuming you have fairly light and low ceilings. (Only really works in landscape orientation where the flash pivots up. The Mk III pivot also goes much further (beyond straight up), and the only downside of the whole line is the flash time which is on the slow side.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Bada-boom!", "unixReviewTime": 1403308800, "reviewTime": "06 21, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A3PR118G6CJYFI", "asin": "B00K7O2DJU", "reviewerName": "radius1", "helpful": [4, 5], "reviewText": "Great camera.

Slight tendency to overexpose. Colors are a bit neutral but mostly accurate in its default setting. Comparable performance to APS-C up to ISO800. Usable through ISO3200, especially if you process RAW. ISO performance about this same as its predecessor. Possibly slightly worse at high ISO than the Canon G1X Mark II but not that far off.-Good performance. Autofocus speed and accuracy seems to have improved on this model. The AF system does a better job of attempting to lock on to a subject in dim conditions. Image stabilization works well.-Great looking video. About the best you're going to find from a compact camera.-Pop up EVF is sharp and bright, and has a decent refresh rate even in low light conditions.-LCD is bright and clear.CONs-Camera shuts off after EVF is put away.-Manual flash button in an awkward position and can sometimes be hard to push.-Still no textured area on the front of the camera for a more secure grip. Come on Sony! Although the previous add on grip fits just fine on the RX100 III. You should not order this camera without it (I think it's about $10-$15 extra).-Menu is a little convoluted.In summary, this is a great update to this line of cameras. It still offers the best mix of high image/video quality for such a small package. Despite the quirks I just mentioned, the camera is generally pretty enjoyable to shoot with and the photos/video give similarly priced APS-C cameras a run for their money at the low and mid range ISOs people use most. If you have the original RX100, should you upgrade? Yes, absolutely. If you have the RX100 II? Well, the lens isn't as sharp but still pretty good. Low light performance is exactly the same. But perhaps you like the longer lens and the hotshoe of the Mark II and don't care about the EVF...then it might be worthwhile to skip a generation. Is the RX100 III worth the extra money?

I liked the camera from the outset and have taken more than a few pictures with it that I am really happy with. It is my choice for backing up my Nikon D4 or D800 when I can't deal with taking along two large DSLRs. I took a look at DXO mark and they rate the sensor the same as the sensor for my old D200 which may sound like damning with faint praise but the D200 was a workhorse and shot a lot of great stuff. I will say at the outset that I like the M3 a lot. I am happy I upgraded from the original but I think that if you have the M2 you may not need this update. The faster lens is a noticeable improvement. Indoor shots without flash at reasonable ISO's are much more feasible now.Updated 6/24/14 - I thought I would add a comment about a statement from the dpreview piece on the M3. Dpreview praises the cameras abilities and then go on to say that it is not \"fun\" to shoot with. I guess an old SX-70 may have been more fun with all the whirring and spitting of prints but beyond that I am at a loss. I have had great creative session with both the M1 and M3. In fact, one of my favorite things about the camera is that is so easy and transparent to handle.Pros:Articulating LCD - I think this is a huge improvement over the original RX100. The ability to easily shoot high or low angle pictures is a great advantage. I have always liked using compact cameras from the ant's eye view and this makes it a lot easier to do. Like most of the construction of the RX100m3, the articulating LCD feels well built but clearly this is not a ruggedized camera. Care must be taken with the flash, EVF and LCD or damage could result. Things don't feel cheap they just don't feel \"battle ready\"Picture Quality - I really like the output of the RX100M3. The pictures are sharp, vivid and relatively free of noise at moderate ISO settings. One of the big improvements in the area of low light is the enhanced widest aperture of the lens. One can pixel peep any lens into a corner (no pun intended) but Sony has done a very respectable job here. I will discuss this more later but by going with a fast, modest zoom with a nice wide end, Sony has created a more enthusiast oriented camera. As Robert Capa said, \"If your pictures aren't good enough, you're not close enough.\"Zoom - As mentioned above the zoom range is modest. I just really like the ability to use 24mm equivalent at the wide end. The zoom speed is quite good. Again, I think it compares favorably to other high-end compacts that I have used.EVF - When I opened the EVF for the first time and look through it was terrible. Then I adjusted the diopter and it was beautiful. Seriously beautiful. This is my first EVF and I like it very much. I can see using it a great deal with this camera.Shutter - The shutters drops very quickly without any undue lag. I really like the burst mode on this camera with the shutter sounds turned off. It is a great way to get very natural candids of friends and family.Neutrals:Weight - The RX100M3 is noticeably heavier than the original. Noticeably but not significantly heavier. Yes, when you pick it up you are just a touch more cognizant of gravities pull but nowhere near the point where you would leave on the table because it's too heavy to deal with. When carrying and using the camera the extra weight never crossed my mind.Size - Certainly related to weight but also a function of adding goodies like the EVF and articulating LCD. I wear a lot of clothes with big pockets and I have never been one to just stuff a compact camera in a pants pocket on an ongoing basis. I have a very small Lowepro belt case for my original RX100 and the new one fits perfectly even with an extra battery tucked inside. The size and weight differences are certainly discreet.Added 6/22/14 The current implementation of the Fn button is very nice. I really didn't use this button in the past but now it brings up a very clear, easy to follow UI for the some of the most commonly accessed functions. I really like this feature.Added 6/22/14 I am growing very fond of the artificial horizon in the EVF. Despite 30+ years of photography I am still amazed how often in Lightroom I have to straighten the horizon. Maybe my head is just tilted. Whatever the cause, the artificial horizon really helps and as a result I am not losing any of the frame having to rotate in post.Cons:Menus - While the menu system on the M3 is improved and certainly better than the old NEX software it could still use improvement. My biggest complaint has to do with navigating between menu categories and sub-menus. To me the UI manipulation is not intuitive but is certainly workable.Functions - Marketing people are wonderful and I know scene modes and scene recognition must be important to some segment of customers but I am not in that demographic. I suppose there is little harm in all the bells and whistles but it is very funny that Sony includes both an Automatic and Superior Automatic mode. When does one say, \"I don't want the superior results, let me kick this baby down to stinky normal Automatic mode.\"Items on which the jury is still out.Wi-fi - I know there are people who can't wait for the favorite camera to come out with built in wi-fi so it can't be dismissed. I would only say that thus far my experience with the RX100M3's wi-fi functions have been cursory and I will amend this review when I am able to be more definitive about my experience.Would I recommend this camera?For a lot of people yes I would. If you are an enthusiast this is a credible compact contender. If you are an ultralight traveller who likes good photos this is also a good choice. If you are thinking of some for an adventure vacation with water, snow, sand or surf, probably better to look at a ruggedized compact.

That's why I was excited to get one for our house.After using it for the last couple of weeks, here are the things I like about it:1) It looks great!  The computer it was replaced was a traditional tower computer, that I had built myself, with a 24\" monitor - and this Dell eliminates both the tower and all associated wires.  Our home office looks a lot cleaner as a result.2) The screen quality is excellent!3) The touch screen is nice - and I've really started to get used to that on Windows 8 systems.  It's kind of hard to switch to non-touch systems once you get used to that feature.4) It runs completely silently.  This is something I demand in all my PCs.5) I hate factory images because of all the bloatware that's installed; and, as a result, I typically reformat and re-install before even booting a system up.  I was in the process of getting my install disks together when I saw a note in the box that said this system shipped with a clean image - so I decided to give it a try.  I'm glad I did because it saved me the time of doing a re-install!  The image is a truly clean Windows 8 system, and I've got to hand it to Dell for finally figuring out that it makes more sense to ship systems without all the additional software.Although I am loving this system in general, I do have one complaint:When looking at the specs, this should be an absolute beast - but it isn't.  I suspect the weak link is the 5400 RPM hard drive - which doesn't match up with the Core i7 and the 12GB of RAM...I've added SSD drives into my other computers, so I'll probably do the same with this one - and that should make this one of the fastest computers I own.At the end of the day, I would highly recommend this system even though the performance isn't quite what I had expected.

I had been previously using a E4200v2 from Cisco/Linksys with mediocre wifi results the last couple of years. I live in a densely populated community with many other wifi nodes around me from my neighbors. I think this tended to cause wifi signal interference. My signal was never strong even when in the same room with the E4200. The typically wifi speed to my iphone/laptop always sat around 30-40mbps on average. With my highest ever score of 52mbps and frequently dipping down into the single digits on bad days. I knew the E4200 was capable of more, but the interference here (even with a dual band router) made it impossible to get great reception.When I first saw the WRT1900AC I loved the fact it was a throw back to their classic blue Linksys WRT 54G (which I owned back in the day too). Moreover, I realized all these externalized antennas will likely help me get better reception.I knew going into this router that it was built around open source, but the chipset OEM is not responding quickly for creating the drivers necessary for the open source crowd to do their thing with this device. Open source firmware is on hold until then. I likely will switch to DD-WRT firmware as soon as it is made available down the road. However, I also knew the stock firmware on a router this nice would likely have \"most\" of what I need in the settings to hold me over. Turning off SSID broadcast, Mac address filtering, various encrypt options, port forwarding, dmz, static IP assignment tables, etc... these are commonly the things I go to first on new router setups and these are all present in current firmware.As soon as I got this router up and running I did a LAN line (non wifi) speed test to see if I got any gains just by way of the higher end internal processor (in case I was bottle-necking on the previous unit). I honestly didn't expect to see any gains on my LAN line performance... I was just being diligent. My previous best speed on LAN line were around 96mbps. The first several tests right out of the box... ALL tested higher than all my previous best scores. I topped out around 124mbps... which is higher than my ISP speed I pay for, but my previous router likely wasn't able to handle those speeds. I was immediately happy with the 1900AC! Real world long duration downloads I am seeing 14-15MBps which is better than I ever did previously!I moved on to WiFi testing hoping for good things after seeing the amazing LAN speed increases. The first test right out the box was the best WiFi speed I got on any device ever to date... anywhere. Remember I said I averaged 30-40mbps on wifi with a best of 52 on my previous cisco router? Well, the first test on the 1900AC was - 92mbps, second test - 88, third test - 94. I have been testing this wifi speed on my iphone for a week now at various times of time since that point. I average low 90's and lowest test I had so far was an 82. This is literally double my average speed in the past and nearly double my best speeds. I COULD NOT BE HAPPIER! :D I finally have good wifi speed in my home. I didn't think it was possible here with all the neighbor interference. I even get great speed at all locations of my apartment even behind a concrete walled area. The strength of the signal is amazing.Some other things that I am not currently using that should be mentioned are the usb/esata ports for external drives. From the tests reviews I have read online, the network drive performance rivals some of the better dedicated units on the market out there right now. This thing is a performer all the way around. The antennas can all be removed and replaced (if you want to upgrade them... I don't see need in doing there where I live, but options are nice). The light indicators on the front are very handy for seeing which band of wifi is being used and which LAN port is currently being used. It should be noted that this unit get very warm with all the processing power it wields. It has an internal cooling fan that turns on if the unit gets hot enough. I have not heard it turn on yet, so I am sure the heat level has to be much higher. It is important that you do not put anything ontop of the air vents of this unit with as warm as it gets. I have it sitting on high shelf with space around the sides and top to keep air circulating.Overall, I love this router. It delivered in literally every single way I wanted. It's faster and more capable in every way than my previous router. The only thing left is that the chip set manufacturer motivates and gets our open source community the drivers they need to put out their firmware. It's the final piece of this puzzle. I am keeping the faith that they will deliver eventually. This was not a deal breaker for me, especially since I got the huge performance leap I was looking for. I have enough tweaks in the stock firmware to hold me over until I can get DD-WRT. The price point is high on this router to be sure, but you know the old adage you get what you pay for, in this case it does apply.If you want one of the best router on the market right now... this is the one.

My other monitor is aDell UltraSharp U2711 27-inch Widescreen Flat Panel Monitor - Max Resolution 2560 x 1440 (WQHD)and it is stunning. But it also came at a price tag of just under $1,000 when I first got it. So I expect more from it. Which is why I can say that this Dell (UZ2715H) is a pretty darn good monitor for the price.SIZE: 27 inches is huge so make sure you have space for it. It sits on a nice pedestal that allows for easy tilting and positioning and it seems well balanced for such a large monitor. I've had no trouble viewing it from the side, no glare and clear images.RESOLUTION: It is surprising that for a monitor this big, it only has a maximum resolution of 1920x 1080. Again, with the understanding of double the price, my original Dell goes to 2650x1440. I was surprised that the resolution was not listed under features so I thought it was important to mention.COMPARISON: I plugged it in as a second monitor to my system. It was really easy then to see them side-by-side. I've been working with them that way now for a week. And yes, I have a large desk to accommodate two 27\" monitors. What I noticed appearance wise is that the Dell UZ2715 is a pretty warm toned monitor. It is not as crisp but it looks great given the max resolution available.I ran it through a color calibration with aSpyder 3 Eliteto see how close I could get the colors between monitors. It stayed a pretty warm tone with a hint of too much red. However, I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of controls available. Brightness/contrast, kelvin, and RGB as individual controls. So with some more fine tuning, I could get it where I wanted it.It also has good energy saving settings and multiple methods to plug it in. I ended up using the HDMI cable although you can also use a USB, DisplayPort or VGA. It took me a bit to realize once I plugged it in that it didn't recognize the input immediately. I had to go to the input section on the menu to select HDMI as the setting.There are also USB ports available in the back but you will probably need to connect the monitor to your computer as a USB device or add the USB cable even though you are sending the picture through HDMI or DisplayPort. In other words, you need to connect the USB ports on the monitor to the USB bus on your computer to have them work properly.The benefit of a built-in webcam and microphone/headphone jack just adds to the great value packed into this monitor.If you are looking for big and beautiful, this is a great place to start.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Large Screen with Bonus Features", "unixReviewTime": 1403913600, "reviewTime": "06 28, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "AGVWTYW0ULXHT", "asin": "B00K9NN1VS", "reviewerName": "Nathan Andersen \"Gadget lover and author of S...", "helpful": [4, 4], "reviewText": "This is a fairly affordable, high value, full-featured external monitor. It delivers a very high quality HD picture. The resolution just goes to 1920 x 1080, so it isn't quite the resolution of my retina screen, but it does look great for watching movies, and the colors are quite vivid. It has a built in HD webcam, that delivers a much nicer-looking image than the webcam built into my Macbook Pro. There's also a microphone built in, which is useful if you plan to use this for Skype. It also has built-in speakers, that sound pretty much like you'd expect the speakers on a 27\" HD television to sound: which is a lot better and louder than the sound you get on my Macbook Pro. So this is great for watching movies. (That's a good thing, too, since I teach film classes, and often need to preview things in my office. I'd much rather preview them on this than on my smaller laptop screen.)You can connect it in a number of ways. The most common would be via HDMI or mini display port. It comes with everything you need, including all of the cables. There's an HDMI cable, a DVI to mini display port cable, and a USB cable. With my Mac I can use this as an external monitor using either the HDMI or the mini display port cables. If I want to use either the webcam or the speakers on the monitor, I have to also plug it in via USB.Usually, though, I just need this for its display. I edit a lot of video in Premiere Pro, and it's useful to have an external monitor that matches the resolution of the video I'm editing -- which is always 1080p -- and this works great for that purpose. I actually have two external Dell monitors -- the other one is Dell's S2740L 27\" monitor. I can connect them both to my Mac and use one for a program monitor and one for my color correction tools. The image looks better with this monitor than with the S2740L. In part that is because the S2740L's screen is glossy, and catches a lot of reflection from around the room. Beyond that, the image from this one just looks more crisp. There is no blur, the lines are crisp, and I can't see any pixelation.One thing that I like better about the older monitor, though, is that it automatically recognizes the inputs you plug in to it. With this one, you have to go in and manually select the input before the monitor will recognize that it has been plugged in. That usually wouldn't be a big deal, but since I do have two monitors and both can be plugged in different ways, and I don't keep them plugged in since I'm using a laptop rather than a desktop, it would be nice if I didn't have to go in and change the settings every time I plug it in. What that does mean is that I have to take a couple minutes getting everything set up every time I want to use this monitor. Not a big deal, but the plug and play ease of the other monitor would be preferable. (In either case, I need to go into my Mac's display settings, because by default they set external monitors to mirror the display on my Mac, rather than to extend the display into two additional desktops.)The control buttons are touch sensitive, and laid out on the bottom right hand side of the screen. It confused me at first because the menu appears on the actual screen above the buttons, and I wanted to select options by touching the screen. Rather, the screen shows you which buttons to press on the panel below the screen in order to navigate the menu. Once you get the hang of it, it is all very intuitive and easy.To sum up: I'm very happy with this monitor. It works great for my video editing workflow, delivering good sound and a high quality full HD image. On the rare occasion -- it does happen but not often -- that I need to make a webcam conference call via Skype or Google, the bigger screen and the better camera will make that easy.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A very nice display, an excellent built-in webcam, good speakers: works great as a second (or third) monitor for my Macbook Pro", "unixReviewTime": 1404950400, "reviewTime": "07 10, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A32LX4XJ2LU740", "asin": "B00K9S353M", "reviewerName": "PositiveLogic \"Looking for Positive, Not Fear...", "helpful": [11, 12], "reviewText": "I can't tell you how many devices I have that charge via a USB cable.

I will keep trying to improve battery life but I am removing a star from my initial review because of battery life.Original ReviewI have been using the ASUS MeMo Pad 7 ME176CX-A1-BK 7-Inch Tablet for a little less than one week now, and so far I am pretty impressed by its performance.  This tablet is super thin and very light, measuring just 7.50 x 4.50 x 0.40 inches and weighing 11.2 ounces. This device is very ergonomic. I find that I am able to use it with one hand (I have average sized hands), which is very convenient while commuting.The latest Android operating system, KitKat 4.4 is installed on the ASUS MeMo Pad 7, and the tablet has the Intel Atom Quad-Core processor and 1 GB RAM, 16 GB on-board, and a slot for a micro-SD card (up to 64 GB). I tested the MeMo Pad 7 with a number of applications, including games, and did not detect any hesitation or stuttering. Video renders nicely, and of course basic web browsing and e-mail are a snap.To compare the display to a similar tablet, I put the ASUS MeMo Pad 7 side-by-side with my Kindle Fire HDX and the Fire's display is sharper and brighter. The ASUS has a 1280 x 800 display, a narrow bezel design and is fine for day-to day-use, especially while traveling.The weakest part of the ASUS MeMo Pad 7 is probably the camera, but this is not a huge deal for me, since I don't use tablets to take photos. I tried to take some photos and noticed the camera lags while trying to take photos indoors.Along with KitKat, the ASUS MeMo Pad 7 has the ASUS Zen UI, which adds additional features to the operating system, including a battery optimization feature that shuts off Wi-Fi when the tablet is not in use, and a \"What's Next\" personal assistant that helps you manage your calendar.There is a lot to like about the ASUS MeMO Pad 7. It is priced lower than most other tablets with similar specs, performs well, and is very thin and very light.

Know about CP/M, Unix System V and good old clicks from a metal made IBM PC/XT keyboard and the CGA color display flickering, I also remember the very first touch screen I've ever touched... The HP 150 (circa 1983).And there's more, I remember when my dad gave me my very first computer: Sinclair ZX-81. I couldn't believe it!!! I was dreaming about writing a software that could take me inside the computer like the Tron movie did while wondering if 1k of memory should be enough!!!. That was a dreaming 8 years old little boy who has always loved technology. That was (and is) me!The reason I bring all the above memories to this review is... Technology now is lacking passion... and now you can have toys that you can use, you can enjoy but you won't love. Yes, you can find a very small bunch of tech giants that sparkles with innovation, experience or design but... for the rest... they just don't listen!!!I do like the Windows 8.1 experience. It is pretty fast, pretty stable and looks modern...the Toshiba P55T-B5262 which is named after a fax machine is good. It is a pretty good laptop with impressive capabilities but an even more impressive list of possibilities. This laptop falls short on design. It is not that it has been badly made... not by any means but it could be a lot better with a little bit more imagination.I reckon it is very hard to fight in the computer business today with the commoditization of the PC but who's fault is that? How much money does the best industrial designer could cost?... Is that much for a corporation? That very question brings me to what I don't like from this laptop:While Toshiba made a good effort in the materials choice for a good priced high end laptop, they felt short in ergonomics, for some reason I can't really point my finger to, I feel a little bit uncomfortable while writing this review (I'm using my brand new Toshi here) and it is not a keyboard fault because I have to say, the keyboard is pretty good, it is like if the track pad was in the wrong position or has the wrong size. I beg you pardon for my imprecision but there's something wrong here and it is not the keyboard. Another minor critic is the fonts used on the keyboard, I think those fonts makes the keyboard to look unfairly cheap,that's the problem when you get too used to a Mac obsessive attention to the details.On the other hand, there's the screen. Impressive I really have to say the screen is. I have to congratulate Toshiba on this one. It looks so good I can only tell a little bit more brightness could be great but... I can't disqualify this display. If you're in a not so bright room, it beats the retina display I have on my Mac Book hands down.The audio... hoooray... Those Harman guys sure know how to make things sound pretty good and maybe the size of the laptop, gives room for a little bit more audio than thinner ones but, the fact is... this thing really sounds good. I do like the sound experience and while it could use a little bit more volume, I also have to say that might be just me because I'm a little bit deaf myself. Too much Walkman/Diskman/Minidisk rock in the 90's and iPod in the 2000's I guess :)The trackpad... just rubbish...beggars belief... I seem to find this kind of rubbish quality track pads everywhere. I had an Acer S7 Ultrabook and that one was even worst. Do they think just because they give you touch screen it can have very bad pads? Toshiba please, I think it has the wrong size or is in the wrong place but that could be only me... but really... get some firmware upgrade from your Synaptics supplier... Or at least ask for more control on the track pad panel... I'd love to be able to disable it.. it is that bad.Now what I like the most apart from the lovely, mesmerizingly good screen and the surfaces touch feeling and the sound is the ability to have not two but four 3.0 USBs (or at least I hope they are 3.0 because they are blue :)), and Ethernet port and an HDMI port on board.As mentioned before, I still prefer my Retina MacBook Pro because of the way it makes you feel but by that said, I'm being a little bit unfair because I've paid twice as much (plus $300 for applecare) for my Retina so it is easier to have better everything (except the display) at twice the price... don't you think?My verdict, this is a rather impressive little fella (well not THAT little anyway) featuring on the positive side:- Impressive display. I mean it... it is very good. The best I've seen since the Retina display and even more impressive for it to be touch.- Good performance and playing with photos is a breeze.- Keyboard besides the look, is very good.- I like the idea of having that numerical keypad.- 4 USBs, 2 on each side.- Blu-Ray Reader, DVD Writer. Which is very good indeed but, having those 2 USBs on each side is very convenient to connect mySamsung SE-506BB/TSBD 6X USB2.0 External Slim Blu-ray Writer Drive (Black)when I have to write a Blu-Ray disk.- Good surface feeling. We are talking about some aluminum surfaces here, not only cheap looking plastics and that feels good at the touch and makes the laptop to look better.- The 12 GB of RAM and the 1TB Hard drive.- Did I mentioned the screen?? ohhh... lovely and it's touch!!!- Another thing I'm noticing while typing this review, the screen seems to repel finger prints pretty cool. I have to try it a little bit more but.. somehow I've been playing with the touch and it does not looks like painted with grease crayons... cool right?- I do have to congratulate Toshiba on including almost no bloatware at all... Good for you Tosh... you deserve a High Five!!!The bad:- The Track Pad... ooohhh boy is bad... not the worst I've ever encountered... that title goes by far to the Acer S7 I had last year.- I find it falls a little bit short on ergonomics and I don't know why but... I think is the size and/or position of the useless track pad. don't know for sure.I like this laptop very much, it is a wonderful value for money and you won't be disappointed if you look at it as a tool... but I wanted to love it, I wanted it to bring back the boy in me... and it didn't.

I use one note extensively. For the last couple of days, I can have about 30 to 40% battery left after my shift ends which is about 8 hours. I use it sparingly, so I think 9 hour battery life claimed by Microsoft sounds reasonable. Notes taking is excellent, and is easy to use. Typing on the type keyboard feel sturdy, but I feel my finger is a little more tired than I type on my MacBook pro retina 15 inch. I think that's due to the bouncing effect from the keyboard, since there is a gap between keyboard and the table if I lift the front of the keyboard up.When I use it at home, I use mostly in tablet format. I used to own surface pro 1, and I know it's heavy when holding it for a long time. This one is lighter, but feels also heavy due to the big size. It's not ideal if you want to hold it for a long time. Surface pro feels cool when just browsing the internet, and it starts to run hot around the top right corner when playing games. My surface pro 1 is warm the whole body. I understand Microsoft moved the window icon to the center of right bezel so users can life the keyboard, but I find myself sometimes touch the button, and it goes to home screen as a result. Also after I lift up the keyboard, I then don't' have access or is difficult to access the menu bard on the bottom of the screen. I guess it's a tradeoff, since you get studier keyboard that way. But you can just not lift up the keyboard if you want to access the bottom menu easier. Screen is gorgeous similar to my surface pro 1, and I feel it's better than my iPad air. I also launched the PhotoShop, but it seems PhotoShop hasn't upgrade its menu bar, the menu title are all very small, and it's very difficult to access them even I increase its size to biggest.

I hope that is a weakness they will fix in the future.My environment: 1800 square foot ranch style home with AT&T; u-verse Elite internet and their generic wireless router.SET UPThe HEOS 3 comes beautifully packaged with the power cable, 3.5 mm audio cable, ethernet cable, and quick start guide. The quick start guide is all you need, because set up is as easy as they make it sound. I downloaded the app, updated the software, and plugged the 3.5 audio cable into my iphone 4s and the speaker. The speaker connected and I labeled it on the phone.THE APPThe included app is ready to play Spotify, Pandora, Tunein, rhapsody, the music on your iphone, and local radio stations.There are three menu options: Rooms (you label each speaker on the app for a different space in your home), music (pick your music), and now playing. You can also turn music sharing on.You can easily swap between any of the speakers and adjust what they are playing along with the volume from anywhere in the house from the app.ADJUSTMENTSThe app allows you to adjust the treble & bass for each speaker. That is about all that is included.THE EXPERIENCEBoth the HEOS 3 & HEOS 5 are loud enough to fill any room in our house, including a very large finished basement. The HEOS 5 has noticeably deeper and fuller sound. It is crystal clear, which surprised me coming through wireless channels. I do not own a Sonos system, but I have played around with them in the store and I prefer the HEOS 5 to the Sonos Play:5. It's a toss up between the HEOS 3 & Sonos Play:3. I prefer my Bose Soundlink II to both 3 models, and the Soundlink is the entry model for Bose.The HEOS 5 is the real winner here. I would put 3's in your bathrooms, workrooms, and kitchen but would not use it as a main speaker for a larger room. The 5 belongs in the living room or den.BUFFER ISSUES: Some other users reported problems with the speakers cutting out. With my Internet set up I have not had that problem unless more than one other bandwidth intensive program, like Netflix is running. If our kids are watching Netflix while my wife is watching it in another room, the sound will break up once in a while.SYNC ISSUES: When playing the same speaker source all of the HEOS speakers play the music perfectly in sync. There is no lag that we have experienced in between any of them.I am happy with the HEOS 3, but am blown away by the HEOS 5. As good as it is, I will have to get my hands on the 7 now.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Denon competes well with the Sonos", "unixReviewTime": 1405382400, "reviewTime": "07 15, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A3OC93X866Z8TB", "asin": "B00KJJW36G", "reviewerName": "Celestialsky29", "helpful": [5, 9], "reviewText": "This review is for the HEOS 3.  This speaker has excellent sound, specifically bass, which is hard to find at times.  You can store the speaker horizontal or vertical, which makes it versatile for any location.  As long as you have a nearby plug in, this speaker is small enough to fit easily in many locations.  It is supposed to be for a small room, but it works well for medium sized rooms as well.Set up was easy, once I changed out my router.  I have an old router that has issues, and my set up wasn't going well.  I pulled out a newer router, and used the enclosed ethernet cable.  Once I did this, the setup process just flew through.  I have an Iphone 5s and a Netgear router.The only thing I don't like about this speaker is that I wish it was bluetooth.  It isn't, and it doesn't claim to be, but it would be nice because then you would be able to play other apps on your speaker.  I use aSony SRSBTX500 Portable NFC Bluetooth Wireless Premium Speaker Systemto play my Sirius radio app, and I love it.  With the Denon speaker, you can only play the apps that come on the HEOS app.  You have Pandora, Tunein, Rhapsody, Spotify and the music that you have loaded to your phone.  In order to be able to use Pandora, for example, you must have that app also downloaded on your phone.  Those are great selections, and some of the best music apps available, but it would be nice to have Amazon Prime music and Sirius available to play.The sound quality of this speaker is awesome!  It plays music on Pandora with such clarity, and the bass is super.  I live in an apartment, so I had to keep the sound turned at a decent volume, which turned out to be about 1/4 of the volume that it is capable of achieving.  The Tune-In app that allows you to play radio, doesn't come in as impressive as Pandora.It will be nice to have several set up, and see how they all work together.

After using it for a few days, I am very impressed with the ease of use and sound quality that the HEOS speakers offer. Setup was a breeze, and I'm actually starting to listen to music again during the day while I work.I expected to encounter some level of pain trying to connect the speakers to my wireless network... not because I have a strange network, but just because those things don't seem to work very intuitively. Much to my surprise, it was close to plug-and-play. I downloaded the HEOS app to my iPhone and unboxed the speakers. Side note on the packaging... high quality and classy packaging... it speaks volumes (a slight pun intended) for what's inside. Set-up involved plugging the speaker into a power outlet, plugging a small cable into the speaker and my iPhone, and pressing the Connect button on the back of my speaker. The iPhone app takes it from there. Both my speakers connected in less than 30 seconds and were listed as separate speakers on my device list. They also updated the software automatically and &#34;rebooted&#34; each speaker. At that point, I had a HEOS sound system!The sound quality is exceptional (to my admittedly non-audophile ears). The bass and treble ranges are excellent, and even at louder volumes there's no distortion. The HEOS 5 (the larger of the two speakers) does have a richer sound, but not by much over the HEOS 3. I have the HEOS 5 down in my mancave office where I can crank it a bit, and the HEOS 3 is up in my wife's sewing room. She loves having something better than her tinny PC speaker now. Even though I have a decent sound system hooked up to my PC, I'm enjoying the HEOS sound more (and liking that my computer isn't running my music programs).The HEOS app is, in my opinion, pretty easy to work with. I set up the speakers using my iPhone, but I wasn't sure what I would get when it came time to set up the app on my iPad and wife's iPhone (and an older one at that). No worries... she downloaded the application, started it up, and it automagically found both speakers on the network with no prompting or searching. She was playing music from her iPhone in less than five minutes after downloading the app. Any time I don't have to play computer or iPhone tech support, I'm happy.Based on my (again, admittedly more limited than some of my friends) music sources, I was pleased with the options for streaming to the HEOS system. The iPhone app recognizes Pandora, Spotify, Tunein, Rhapsody, and the actual iPhone/iPad. I have my limited music collection on iTunes (and sync'd with my iPhone), so I was happy to play from there to the HEOS. I sort of &#34;rediscovered&#34; Pandora over the last few days, too. I've been enjoying putting it on one of the &#34;radio station&#34; channels I had in my Pandora account, and just letting it play over the HEOS. Over time, I'd like to see more music sources be available, but for my typical usage, this is a good selection.My friends are always raving about their Sonos systems and how they can have different music playing in different rooms controlled by different people. I used to think &#34;so what?&#34; as it wasn't that important to me. Now having played with the HEOS system, I &#34;get it&#34; and will forever be spoiled by not having to listen to music via headphones or less-than-wonderful speakers. I'll also be spoiled knowing that I can move my speakers around to any room if needed, and I can create ambience wherever I'm at in the house.Disclosure:Obtained From: Amazon Vine Review ProgramPayment: Free", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I'm forever spoiled...", "unixReviewTime": 1405900800, "reviewTime": "07 21, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A20OBCQWBKCGZT", "asin": "B00KK9481I", "reviewerName": "Flaherty", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "I was very disappointed with these speakers.

Their 'windows' button on the screen is kind of annoying cause it is right where I'd put my hand.

With that said do keep in mind that some things may differ from the final retail product but for the most part part things should generally be the same.Ill do my best to keep this review straight to the point. Also keep in mind that my previous highest router was a Netgear WNDR3700 running third party firmware Gargoyle. To make a comparison to this router isn't really fair but its also my only point of reference.DesignYou either love it or you hate it. In my opinion the design looks industrial, futuristic and maybe even over the top with the antennas extended out; it makes me think of a Robotic Spider. The design may not have the universal appeal of the previous R7000 but I like it.Design Pros:-Open vents on top for great airflow and heat dissipation but with this increases the possibility of dust being collected over time  (Keep that router clean) but overall this is worth the trade off.-Ability to switch LEDs ON or OFF-Unit comes in a matte black finish (I like that this finish reduces the look of finger prints, dust, and scratches)-Having all ports on the rear is a plus as it makes wall mounting setup/cable management easier to deal withDesign Cons:-Router has a large foot print-The antennas when extended do feel delicate and the design is such that the antennas on this unit aren't user replaceable. Same if the unit is wall mounted and you have the antennas projected outward. (Be careful!) This isn't an issue if the unit is set in area out of the way.-When wall mounting the text on the router is upside down but this is a minor quip-Little to no tactile response when pressing the buttons on top of the routerUsability/PerformanceStraight up - This router performs!!! I've had 10 plus devices connected to this thing at one time at least half of those devices were streaming and or downloading content and this router didn't skip a beat! Top notch performance! Now I have to say for the techies doing heavy torrenting and/or usenet depending on the setup of those apps you could still negatively affect or impact your network if you choose to max out connections using said apps however again for normal everyday situations this router screams! Also the router has a good feature set. (I love features and functionality which is why install 3rd party firmware on all of my routers) The stock firmware covers the basics well in this respect. Printer/USB drive sharing is an easy affair to setup. OpenVPN support is included as well. This is a minor gripe but I wish there was better or more advanced QOS options available like throttling a single IP or mac address and creating QOS tiers and such.Pros-High throughput and fast speeds throughout whether downloading/streaming from the internet or streaming a local network share/usb drive from your network-Wifi load balancing across the 5GHz radios works well and is seamless-Strong 5GHz range (when comparing my older WNDR3700)-Fast wireless transfer speeds to USB drive connected on USB3 port (I averaged 80-90mbps with an attached 3TB Toshiba External using the 5GHz band)-USB Storage sharing works great in conjuction with DDNS. Easy setup to access/share files from anywhere on the net.Cons-Slow router setup/interface. When making changes/applying settings the router will (for the most part) usually require a reboot. When applying settings this can take about 15sec to apply and most times internet/wireless connectivity is interrupted in the process.-Lacking advanced QOS featuresI heavily use 3rd party firmware such as DD-WRT or OpenWRT and one strong feature of it,(at least for the most part) is that a user can configure many aspects of router settings, then save settings in one section and move on and configure the next section and so on. Then when the user is ready to commit the changes, they can select to apply the changes and have the settings be applied and router reset if necessary in one go round.Doing this would greatly speed up the router setup and reduce the many router/connection resets that currently occurs in the setup of the current firmware.Overall ImpressionsAs mentioned before this is a beast of a router!

I wanted a router with a bit longer 5ghz range as I had a D6200 in back of my AT&T; uverse, and the 5ghz signal was iffy in my room like 35ft away from the router.  This R8000 seem to be the latest with all the bells and whistles.  They touted long range with 6 antennas.  The -.5 is for the antennas.  For 299 retail you'd expect a little more quality.  You pull the antennas up and they feel like they're just gonna break off, very flexy flimsy feeling, but no problems once they're in place.  Not sure if they are helping or not yet, haven't had time to adjust them, they will stay put at 45 degrees and 90.

The setup is identical to any other netgear router, so it was easy.  You can keep the 2 - 5ghz signals separate with 2 different ssid's, or combine them which I did using one ssid.  I didn't see much difference either way as the netgear seemed to divide up the online devices between the two, so I just let netgear do it instead of me having to put in a new ssid for half my devices.  So setup, I was up in less then 30 minutes, since I had a netgear already.  I updated the firmware and seems pretty stable.  Well for the 2 days I had it so far, it's been rock steady.  All my devices are at the same IP's so I know it hasn't rebooted as one of my devices is on an access point with dhcp built in and that always changes when the router reboots.  So far it's been pretty good.  All my devices have the 5 wireless bars and connections excellent throughout my smaller house.  I was only getting 2 bars in my bedroom with the D6200, so it's a little better then 2x the D6200.  I haven't tested my tablet outside, but that will be the next test.  I will post any negatives I find as I work with this, but so far it's a straight forward design and tried and true setup interface that's pretty easy to setup.  If you have an RG3800 and need info on how,  post a msg, i'll try to explain it.  Oh and I was connecting at low 200's Mbps with an AC1200 adapter,  but now it's always 650Mbps and above in my room,  any closer and it always connects at the AC1200 speed which is 867Mbps.  And the rest you can get from specs online, basically on/off button, usb 2 and 3,  4 Ethernet gigabit ports, 1 wan.Update: So far had it about a week and it's been working great.  I have my security cams forwarded with upnp on with no problems now.  Everything is working as it should.  I was a linksys fan, but this is working great for me.

To pull in a weak signal, this adapter really works! 4.5 stars (rounded to 5).BACKGROUND:  To test this adapter, we used a new model Acer laptop in our home's n-network.  Our wifi signal varies depending where you are in our home (or if you're outside our home; we have thick, hurricane impact windows and doors).  When the Acer laptop was receiving a 1-, 2- or 3-bar signal, switching to this Wifi adapter bumped up the signal strength 2 bars!  I don't know the actual dB measure of what a 5-bar meter is on a laptop, but I do know that more bars = stronger signal.  Using this wifi adapter seriously surprised me at what a difference it made.WHAT WE LIKED:- It works!  It noticeably improved the signal reception of our home's wifi signal.  It actually impressed my college son who helped test this antenna for me.- It was a cinch to install under Windows 8.  It was plug-n-play all the way, with no drivers to install.- Windows 8 lets us pick which adapter to use to select to the available networks.WHAT WE WISHED IT HAD:- Our network is dual-band, so we have a 5Ghz band that we typically use.  This antenna only works with the 2.4Ghz.  2.4Ghz has more interference than 5Ghz, which is why we opt for the 5Ghz band.  Also, the 5Ghz band would benefit from an adapter like this, because its range degrades quickly the further you move away from the router.CONCLUSION:  Excellent product if you can deal with the large antenna size and 2.4Ghz band of your n-network!

The reader has a short integral USB cord, and ports for compact flash (CF), SD, and micro SD cards.  Beneath a plastic a flip up cover, is a compartment with dedicated storage spaces for one CF, one SD, and one micro SD card.When you insert a micro SD card into the reader, it smoothly and securely clicks into place, and the chances of it accidentally falling out are remote.  For the SD card slot, the card slides in  about 0.4\", and there is no positive \"click\".  The card may not fall out, but I would feel more comfortable, if it went in a little deeper.Unfortunately, there are some significant issues with the CF card slot.  There are guides that are intended to slide into the slots on the sides of the CF cards, but they are too short and don't extend far enough to do a very good job.  It isn't that easy to slide a CF card into the reader, and have it mate smoothly with the 50 pins.  When the pins do not align properly with the holes in the CF card, damage can occur to the contact points.  If a pin is bent, you might be able to straighten it out, but if a pin is broken, replacement is probably your only option.After I inserted a couple of different CF cards, I took a look at the pins, and a couple of them were already out of alignment, and one was severely bent.  After just a few attempts, the reader was no longer useable.  This is pretty much a deal breaker, as I can't recommend any reader that might damage a card.Based on past experience, Sabrent usually does a better job of design than this.

This very product is very similar to the Duo Bluetooth Receiver by CoolStream and it's ironic that they both showed up in the same time frame. It's the Geek God showing me a sign of comparing them to see which one is better for you and I - the average consumer.The little gadget that I want to share with you guys and girls today is the Wi-Fi Audio Receiver (WF-RADU). There's a lot to talk about something so small and very affordable. Let's get started, shall we?What's in the Box?Sabrent is known for packing their products very well to ensure that it will arrive at your house safe and still in one piece. Other competitors should take note and step up their packing game due to the fact that the customer will judge a product first on it's impression. Anyways, you will receive the:- Sabrent Wi-Fi Audio Receiver (WF-RADU)- User Manual- Customer Support InformationThey didn't include a lot mainly because this little gadget works with hardly anything extra.Where Does the Wi-Fi Audio Receiver Exceed?Unlike it's competitor, CoolStream, this little gadget plays audio via your home Internet connection rather than Bluetooth. This means that more of your devices are able to play audio to a pair of wired speakers that can now become wireless with the simply addition of this little gadget by Sabrent.This means you can use your smartphone, tablet, Windows, and Mac computer mainly because the audio that is played to the little gadget is via AirPlay. Sabrent has even taken note that Apple has this pre-configured in their iDevices (i.e. iPod touch, iPhone, and iPad) as well as making sure that Android users has this benefit, too. On the other hand, Windows users are out of luck but that's a whole different story.Due to the Wi-Fi Audio Receiver playing music via the connection of Wi-Fi I have noticed that the signal was a lot stronger than Bluetooth. My Internet speed is pretty fast and the connection is solid no matter if I used a smartphone or a tablet.Where Does the Wi-Fi Audio Receiver Lack?AirPlay is known for playing multimedia from iOS devices and since the Wi-Fi Audio Receiver depends on this it kind of kick some people in the butt. Basically, those users, like myself, that own a Windows Phone won't have the luxury to use this little gadget like those that own an iDevice or/and Android device. I will continue to search for apps that use AirPlay for Windows Phone until then this isn't a recommended product for Windows Phone users.Besides the lacking support for Windows Phone users I also see a BIG difference from their main competitor, CoolStream, which is that there's no built-in battery. The Duo Bluetooth Receiver from CoolStream offers a built-in 8-hour battery while the Wi-Fi Audio Receiver requires you to plug it into a USB port (i.e. Computer, Wall Outlet, etc.).How the Wi-Fi Audio Receiver Fit in my Life?Personally, I don't see myself using this gadget mainly because the lack of support for Windows Phone as well as being required to plug it into a USB port just to power it. I do have the option to bring a portable battery charger but that's a bit much and I don't see myself having a big interest with it.I believe that this gadget fits better for a user that have a pair of speakers that are not in use but are near an outlet or/and computer and want them to use them again with the help of the Wi-Fi Audio Receiver. Basically, they will be able to control the audio in their home from anywhere inside and outside of their house.Why Should You Purchase this for Yourself?Do I recommend it?
