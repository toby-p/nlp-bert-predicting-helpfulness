It has all the components - antagonistic exes, broken hearts, friends, intimacy, and family turmoil.  The characters were well developed and real with distinct personalities.  The main characters are robust and interesting with spirit. I loved the character of Ryan - he was handsome, sweet, and a good friend. He was attracted to Laurel but chose to help her and James see that they needed each other, instead of pursuing his own desires. James - he's sexy, determined, and a great catch when caught. I was surprised by his occupation though. I saw him more as the architect type. Laurel - the beautiful, broken hearted girl looking for a good time with no strings attached to prevent further hurt. And then the story wouldn't be complete without Alex - the evil, antagonistic ex that wants James for more than a hook-up.I enjoyed the multiple POV's and thought they added depth to the characters. I enjoyed seeing James lay his feelings out for Laurel and get real. It was also refreshing to see a woman not recognize so end she had slept with prior for a change.

Things are going pretty good for him, until he gets an email to his own email address, not a throwaway account.  Someone knows.  And they know where he lives.This book is a showcase on the bad idea that is cat-fishing online.  It was a really effective story, with a lot of tension, and great pacing.  It was a fairly quick read, but not in a bad way.  It was as long as it needed to be, to keep the tension, and keep you interested.The main thing with these thrillers, however, are the plot twists throughout.  While I did &#8220;sort of&#8221; see one of the twists coming (of COURSE Rose Bud is the sled!), that twist itself was handled really well.  And the others that I didn't see coming were even better.  I go back and forth when it comes to twists in stories, and whether they are good or not.  Ideally, you shouldn't see it coming AT ALL, but if it&#8217;s completely out of nowhere, that is a bad twist.  The best twists you can see coming, but you don&#8217;t want to believe them.

Number thirteen is labeled a dark romance, which as you probably know by now i'm so drawn to. But this was sooo different than anything else i've read.

After reading the synopsis I knew the story would hook me from the very beginning &#8211; and boy it did! I didn&#8217;t want to put it down for a second. Although the blurb already said it is not a BDSM romance this book was nowhere near what I would have expected. The first half is dark and twisted and had me always second-guessing what might happen next &#8211; the other half is just plain beautiful and deeply moving. It is that kind of story that stays with you long after you finished reading.Thirteen girls wake up disoriented and helpless in an unfamiliar environment. All of them have a number between one to thirteen tattooed onto their wrists. Terrified, they have tons of questions:Where are they?Who are these other girls?What happened to them?What will happen to them now?As if it is not worse enough that they know nothing about their current situation &#8211; they also have no memory at all about their past lives &#8211; hell, they cannot even remember their own names!Soon they learn that they all are held captive by one mysterious Master who they have never seen and that their lives will be at his mercy, full of servitude and &#8211; if they don't obey &#8211; pain. Their MasterHow will they cope with all this? Are they going to fight to get back their rights &#8211; their stolen lives &#8211; no matter what the consequences might be? Or would it be better to just give up in order to satisfy the Master?Thirteen is a meaningful number for William. It is the number he associates with the most important lesson life taught him &#8211; the number that has formed him to the man he is today &#8211; a monster.Now it is his turn to teach these thirteen girls a lesson. All of these girls are chosen for a reason, because all of them are destroyed and broken in some way or another. They have to learn to trust William, to believe that everything he does serves a purpose; that they have to follow his rules or get punished if they don&#8217;t, to learn that these rules are necessary to protect them.But also William has to learn: He needs to believe that not everyone judges him based on the incidence that connects him to the number thirteen, that not everyone thinks of him as a monster.The book&#8217;s POV alternates between William&#8217;s and Number Thirteen&#8217;s. It helps to understand William on one hand and on the other you witness how Number Thirteen copes with this whole situation and how she discovers her past anew. &#8230;but most of all you experience the two of them developing feelings for each other, no matter the messed-up situation they are in. It is a unique and precious love unlike any other I have read about.Oh, William! After reading the prologue I was on his team immediately! My heart broke for him&#8230; several times. It made me trust him from the very beginning. I believed that he meant the girls no harm, no matter his suspect and arguable orders. I also think his hiding in the beginning served two purpose: Encouraging the girls to fear him even more but hiding his monster from them at once.I am absolutely digging this story! It is about survival, courage and bravery, fear and sadness, hope and faith and, most importantly, it is about trust and love. This story hit me deep in my core and I know it will stay for me for a long time. It is a book that is definitely worth a re-read!There is only one question that was never answered and that still bothers me: What really happened to Number Six??? I don&#8217;t think it is what all the girls are suspecting&#8230; but I&#8217;ll leave it at that, as I don&#8217;t want to spoil it.

All I know is whatever the reason, it is somehow tied to Sarah, Dylan's dead wife.Some more information comes to light in book 4, but it only deepened the mystery. We find out who Q is, Riley is up to no good, Nick reveals some more info and his true identity is revealed, which blew my prior theory. Also Dylan tells Jesse all about Sarah and his marriage, another theory on paper thrown in the trash. So as I sit here typing I still ponder the final direction the author will take since it is to conclude in book 5.As for Jess, I am happy she told Dylan some info she has discovered, because that may be her only saving grace to have a future with this man. She has hidden so many secrets and took and spent corporate money from the shady music company that her hole is pretty deep. Dylan only wants one thing, Jess. Someone he can love and trust whole hardheartedly. She has had plenty of opportunities to come clean and not once has she done that.

Adopted at a young age by incredibly strict parents, forced to forget her past and raised in a religious zealot&#8217;s home, the only real light in her life is her sister Beth. When Beth married a motorcycle club member Razer, Lily&#8217;s life was flipped upside down and hasn&#8217;t necessarily settled yet.Shade first saw Lily when Razer met his wife Beth. Knowing she was too young for any sort of relationship, Shade has bided his time and watched from afar. Yet as life and circumstances seem to have Lily falling farther and farther into a black hole, Shade finds himself the only one that can break into her psyche. At first Lily is appalled at the lifestyle the bikers, their blatant disregard for privacy and their openness with one another. However, as she gets to know the people within the club, she realizes she has never been more wrong in her life.I had enjoyed the Last Riders Series but have been looking forward to Shade and Lily&#8217;s story from the very beginning. I was worried I may have been building the story up in my head but was happy to realize that I was worried for nothing. Longer than I remember her other novels being, Begley takes her time and really tells the story that needs to be told.Lily had seemed like such an injured kitten in the previous books. She still seems like an injured soul, don&#8217;t get me wrong, but the background is finally explained. A horrific history and an especially horrible early childhood has created this manic young woman who honestly doesn't know who she is.A well developed romance, Shade and Lily&#8217;s road to romance is rocky but ultimately completely satisfying. At times I found Shade&#8217;s behavior overbearing and a bit hard to believe, but I think within the context of the story Begley was trying to tell it worked.

I enjoyed the chronological flow of the book because it allowed the reader to see their lives during the course of a year, along with all the changes and growth that can happen in that time.  Sean and Rusty have been in a relationship for several years, and when Sean graduates with a mechanical engineering degree there are some struggles to find a job in their hometown of New Orleans.  Rusty already has a job with his family's company of landscape designers, and the thought of leaving New Orleans is frightening for him.  When Sean receives a job offer from a company in Boston, the pair need to decide what their next steps will be.  In each stage of the book they are supportive of one another and work hard to ensure that their partner feels secure and loved.  The book addresses the pain of geographic distance and the stress of the unknown mixed with the excitement of independence, especially when Rusty moves to Boston to join Sean after the job training is completed.  It also does a good job of exploring the similarities between expanding your comfort zone with moving, work, and new friendships with the challenges of addressing issues with your past or self-perception.  This was a book that successfully mixed both the serious and the sweet.One of my favorite things about this book was the way the author structured the inner thought processes for the characters, because they felt very true to life.  It can be challenging to convey the thoughts and emotions that go into compromises and the give-and-take of relationships, and this book does a good job of showing how the love that Sean and Rusty have for one another helps them bridge their differences and their worries to try and make the best choices for their relationship.There were a handful of typos, but they were easy to move past because the story was so compelling.  Part of me was hoping for a bit more detail about how Sean and Rusty made the shift from best friends to a couple when they were younger, but that was largely due to the fact that I enjoyed reading about them so much that I was curious about as many facets of their romance as possible.  I will absolutely be interested in reading more about them when the author has a chance to continue their story, which was hinted at with a teaser at the end of the book.I greatly look forward to reading more from Chris Cox, both in this series and in his other works.

We are drawn into their lives one stage at a time seeing their fears and triumphs, doubts and joys and each hurdle they cross as they find their lives together changing and seeing as they grow and change with it.Meant to be:Sean has finished college and is struggling to find a job and to add to his worries they have to move out of student housing, Rusty is secure in his job at his father&#8217;s landscaping company and is looking forward to moving back to his parent&#8217;s house until Sean gets a decent job.These two men have been sweethearts since they first knew they were gay, Sean moved in to Rusty&#8217;s family home when his father beat him for being gay and the two are inseparable. Sean now wants to embark on the next part of their lives but feels that unless he is contributing then he is failing, but his confidence is low after thirteen interviews and no job in sight. Rusty is very close to his family and knows that they will always be there for him and Sean, Rusty has always loved Sean but when Sean finally gets a job offer it causes friction and as the time draws closer for Sean to give an answer will their love be enough to see them through.I loved this story as we see a very insecure Sean and a very confident Rusty working through a difficult decision that causes friction between them. With Sean&#8217;s past it would have been easy for him to fall back into the security that he found in Rusty and his family but the opportunity he has been offered is too good for him to turn his back on, and we see him finding the confidence to go for what he wants. With Rusty we see him having to let go of the security he has always known for the unknown that he will have with Sean. I loved seeing how love wins through against the doubts and fears and hoe Rusty gave up the security for Sean.Moving On:It has two month&#8217;s since Sean moved to Boston for his new job and Rusty has missed him something fierce, now Sean is coming home after setting everything up and Rusty will be returning with him. Sean has missed Rusty and hopes he has set everything up so Rusty can just fit seamlessly into a new life in Boston, but as they meet at the airport they both feel something is just a bit off.Oh now this has just a bit of angst as Rusty has let his imagination run just a bit wild after Sean has described everything he has been doing and the friends he has made. Rusty is used to Sean leaning on him for everything but now with Sean being alone in Boston Rusty feels like Sean has been moving on without him. Sean has had to move out of his comfort zone to make sure Rusty doesn&#8217;t feel like he lost everything, so he has made friends, found an apartment and checked out the local sites to show Rusty, but he couldn&#8217;t help trying to make Rusty a tiny bit jealous.Hmmm there&#8217;s nothing like spending two months apart to really test a relationship, and no matter how much you love someone the fear of betrayal and loss is still there. Rusty has torn himself up with worry when he noticed that the phone calls were getting shorter or being missed altogether but even with the doubts in his mind he isn&#8217;t letting Sean go. Sean has his own doubts when Rusty pulls out a condom and it takes a heart to heart for them to get back on an even road.Tricked Up for Treats:As Sean and Rusty struggle to make ends meet Rusty splashes out on tickets to a Halloween competition, Rusty thinks that it will be a great way for Sean to relax and be more at ease with his feminine side. Sean is reluctant at first but gives in knowing that it will be a bring some of the sparkle back to Rusty&#8217;s eyes as the worries of being jobless have been wearing away at Rusty&#8217;s spirit.I really loved this one as both men try to please the other. Sean hates anything that reminds him of his father&#8217;s constant bullying, and dressing in drag has the words that his father drilled into him rolling through his mind, but for Rusty he will do anything. Rusty wants Sean to relax more and embrace his more feminine nature, being free to walk and act how he wants and Rusty thinks that the drag competition will help with that. Both men trying to boost the other and having a blast while doing it, having their love support them and showing both of them that they can do anything together.Jingle My Bells:After winning a prize for the drag competition and swapping it for two plane tickets Rusty and Sean are heading back to New Orleans for Christmas, it is a time that awakens both Sean and Rusty to how far they have both come and how things have changed.Ah there&#8217;s nothing like going home for Christmas to make you realise just how much you have grown up and that everything moves on and changes. As Rusty and Sean visit Rusty&#8217;s family for Christmas they both see how they have grown as a couple, doing things for themselves instead of relying on the parents and starting their own traditions, and we also see as Rusty and Sean realise just what freedom they have living alone with no constant interruptions. We also see how far Sean has come and also healed as he does his yearly Christmas present drop on his parent&#8217;s porch; there is also a light of hope as he gets a visit from his sister and his mom.Better or worse:Sean and Rusty&#8217;s wedding is days away and Sean is worried that he has messed up at work, he worries that he will lose his job and that he made a mistake dragging them both to Boston. Rusty knows Sean has something to tell him but he knows that he will be there to support Sean no matter what. They are about to embark on the next step in their life and nothing will stop them from standing together and facing the world.This was a wonderful little story that shows us exactly how far both Sean and Rusty have come and how far they have grown as a couple and as individuals. Sean handles his work problems with panache, facing them head on even though he feels fear. Rusty ups his search for a permanent job as Sean confides his fears about his job. And while all this is going on they are preparing for their wedding and the step that will take them onto the next journey in their life.****My overall rating for these books is 4 Hearts and I would have to say that each step in their journey is just as good as the last. I absolutely adored how the author never stepped back from showing each man&#8217;s fear or their triumphs, we see the remarkable journey they take to fully become the men that they deserve to be and it was wonderful to see that even as they have ups and downs their love never falters and just got stronger. Sean and Rusty are two men that deserve all the happiness in the world, we see their happiness at the simplest things and how they work as a couple to make things work for them&#8230; standing together and leaning on each other to get through life.I recommend this to those who love seeing love deepen and grow, who love watching relationships develop and work through the ups and downs of life, who love characters who develop and grow even as they grow closer to their lover, and to those readers who love watching pivotal moments unfold into something incredible.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "4 Hearts from MM Good Book Reviews", "unixReviewTime": 1396310400, "reviewTime": "04 1, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "AG7ZPVWR3W5DH", "asin": "B00J4DHKKC", "reviewerName": "Diana L", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "This story opened in a way that showed me I was in for a good read and I wasn&#8217;t disappointed.

Some of us grow beyond those inherited beliefs, be they secular or religious and, through much self-work, experience, we form our own, live our lives along the paths we have plowed with so much effort shedding the beliefs previously presented as truths by our fore-bearers.Some of us abide in a place where we divide our loyalties between those who  think and believe as we do; find support in those of similar life patterns of belief and life styles, and find others whose lives are different as we see them among &#8220;enemies&#8221; of our way of life. Others try to remain open to conflicting points of view, trying to bridge gaps; trying to open communication and remain unaffected by propaganda, distorted religious dogmas, yellow journalism, and yes, just down and out plain lies and hyperbole.That being said, as humans when things, whatever they may be&#8212;economic, terrorist, job loss, &#8220;unacceptable&#8221; life styles that upset previous  &#8220;normalcy&#8221;&#8212;we  look, intentionally or unintentionally, for scapegoats;  for someone to blame, rather than ourselves for our perceived misfortune; for the perceived invasion of what we have designated as our neat and tidy artificially perfect, or not so perfect, life. Some accept responsibility which is good, moves one forward, but perhaps we should also ask what outside forces have impacted on us from areas previously never considered.So, what has all this to do with the 29 Conspiracies of the Orphan Trilogy?What if we think we are our own puppet masters; that we pull our own strings, and that is not now, nor never has been, the way of it?  What if those we consider THEM to our US, are not really the THEM that pull the strings, but that THEIR strings are being pulled; kept so deeply entangled with ours to keep us both too busy with &#8220;conflict&#8221; at  personal/national/international levels to notice the strings that are tying our heads and theirs up in knots?What if behind this veneer of civilization; behind this veil that obscures our sight, there are who lurk in the shadows&#8212;there are those to whom &#8220;regular people&#8221; are simply devices to be &#8220;educated&#8221; to produce the demand for what they supply&#8212;legally, illegally, out in plain sight, under the proverbial table of decency, honor, and every other word that supposedly defines one as a righteous woman or man?Once upon a time in November we were dismissed early for prom night.I was on a bus when I heard the news that shattered a dream. There was no prom that night. Everyone sat in horror in front of the television for days.Did we believe then, do we believe now, that our president was murdered in the way we were told? Not many of us, just as not many of us believed what we were told about Martin, about Bobby. Too many variables, too many too quick answers, too much at stake for such simplistic answers. But perhaps the explanation was to make us feel better in such a terrible time of betrayal?We do so like to feel good, thus, the pharmacological industry spends millions on advertisements about drugs that will help our hearts, our arthritis, our allergies and a host of other ailments. Everyone, every actor, in them seems the picture of health, tiptoeing through the tulips, bouncing a grandchild on our knees. And then, then come the warnings about possible side-effects from  everything from strokes to promiscuity, and, oh yes, kidney failure. That is in the fine print, in the sotto voce voice.We like to feel good, so corporations and banks all make advertisements around the idea that they care so much about us, maybe even give us an astonishing 1% back on our credit cards that carry usurious rates of interest, while paying less than that in interest on our savings accounts&#8212;and, well, yes, there were all those too good to be true mortgages that allowed us to find, maybe not keep, but find our homes.We are engaged in &#8220;endless war&#8221; against terrorists who could, will, are coming from wherever. We have color coded alert levels, a &#8220;permanent&#8221; loose coalition  of ill defined but always disparaged enemies with hordes of WMD's&#8212;somewhere.In the news there are those &#8220;meetings&#8221; of heads of state, CEO's of corporations, CEO's of banks just there to talk things through for the betterment of all. And if, indeed, they are there for the betterment of all, why is all kept sub rosa&#8212;secret...what happens in wherever, stays in wherever.We feel good that slavery is illegal, immoral, and yet close our eyes and ears to the horror of it still existing in many areas including sexual slavery increasingly rampant across the world. Would that donut you might be dunkin' while reading this truly taste as sweet if you really acknowledged that many of those contemporary slaves are children&#8212;prepubescent children armed with rifles, with shovels, or used as sexual slaves, forced physically through punishments or induced drug addictions?Surely they did not volunteer for service or have naps with cookies.And what is that little whatzit inside your cell phone, i Pad, etc. that is not available in huge quantities; that could make the country that has it rich, but which instead knows poverty and war? Wonder why?Does 200.000 billion seem like a lot of money to you? Does it seem a lot of money when it could end hunger worldwide? Have you checked out the costs of war in Iraq and Afghanistan? If we are so innately bellicose, if we so love war, can someone tell me why those who fight them are changed forever, suffer so many horrid physical aftermaths, and wake screaming, live screaming with PTSD? If were are innately bellicose, why are there 22 veterans suicides a day in the States alone?How necessary really is war, and what are the true causes behind it&#8212;what are the real profits behind it, and who is making them?What is the real cost of war in human terms? How many have come back, this is not even counting those who live in country, with TBI, with spinal cord injuries? How many KIA, WIA, MIA, in armies and civilian populations? If you don't know, why not?Why is the continent of Africa, so rich in resources, so devastatingly poor in so many areas?Are we mind controlled by some devious force in endless ways, subliminal ways? Are we becoming conditioned to drones making strikes, watching our movements; to subversion of our communication systems? If were are becoming conditioned to &#8220;collateral damage&#8221; of so many kinds, from whence cometh the conditioning? Who are those men who stare at goats?Are we really citizens united when some of us barely can make our electric bills, put food on the table, and others POUR millions into elections?Are you like Mulder, do you want to believe that they are out there, maybe even here, here even for a long, long time and not just sitting about munching on bonbons?

Of Darkness and Crowns was pretty exciting because there&#8217;s a lot of plotting and confrontations throughout, as both sides are preparing for war and the arrival of the goddess - Bale.I enjoyed seeing how deep Bale&#8217;s hold is on Caben. He struggles with her dominating his mind at times, but he manages to find a way to dull her for a while. His passion for Kal is still strong and he is not sure whether he wants to kill her or love her. One thing is certain; he does not want Bale to have her&#8230;Kal is protecting Caben&#8217;s kingdom from the Prince himself, but she wants to save him no matter the cost. She knows that he is still in there with Bale, and can see sparks of him when they are together. Kal also struggles with her faith for her goddess and empress. She is not sure if they are doing the right things and is unsure of what they want from her.Kal and Caben did reunite a few times throughout this book and I was excited to see the tension and passion that still exists between them. But with Bale still inside Caben, they struggle to hold that connection again. It was also exciting to see a lot of the characters from the first book returning too. They support Kal with everything she does, whether it&#8217;s good or bad.Trisha weaved some darker elements into this story, due to the evil that is trying to take over the world, and at times it may leave you gasping!

Their instant attraction and fraternizing led them to falling in love, trying to hide it and eventually, getting called out for it. Now both of their careers as Marines are on the line as consequences, and possibly so is their relationship.In this amazing follow-up and ending to their story, they endure the fight and struggle to make it through the system and somehow keep their love intact. But what happens when you can&#8217;t trust anybody, people who you thought were friends and family call you out, and have one pissed off First Sergeant that seems to be gunning for you both? Welcome to Alex and Cassie&#8217;s world on base Twentynine!The consequences to the fraternizing policy are dealt with but Alex and Cassie have to fight every step of the way. The Marines uphold important rules and value the importance of obiding them, maintaining proper procedures of consequences if such rules are broken. Both of them knew this prior to establishing their relationship. What they didn&#8217;t know was how everything would play out, testing their love and devotion to one another. It seemed like with every step, there was a barrier for them to struggle to break through and their road to happiness would not start off easy.This is a beautiful struggle for them to learn the meaning of Compromising. Alex admits he will screw up but Cassie is just the one to give him s*** when he deserves it. With everything going on with the legality of their fraternization, miscontrued friendships and family issues, can their love for one another overcome the road blocks and push on?Compromising was a fantastic conclusion to Alex and Cassie&#8217;s story. They really went through so much that your emotions were just so up and down. Alex is a hard, alpha, military badass that when he is passionate and loves something, nothing and no one will penetrate that aura around him and that object of love. Cassie has a dedication to prove herself. Her mom knocked her ego down growing up so the joining the Marines was her escape to prove herself. On that journey to being her own badass, she saw the light in Alex&#8217;s dark and was able to show him that he doesn&#8217;t need to be all Alpha all the time, to see the logic in a situation. Cassie was his calming and voice of reason. Their love was definitely tested but in the end, they both realized love was winning out, they&#8217;re better together than they are apart.Again, a GREAT story and GREAT ending! Absolutely LOVED the epilogue! This story does toy with your emotions and you may shed some tears with the events that go on but it&#8217;s real, this s*** does happen whether we like it or not. Alex and Cassie get their happily ever after and then some but again, it&#8217;s not an easy road to get through. Riley and Nat were great, as was Dalton!

There were things I liked and disliked like most books. Some things I enjoyed were the secondary characters and their contribution to the story. It&#8217;s always helpful to get to know the main characters through thoughts from secondary characters. Gives me a better feel for them. Justice and Nic had great chemistry. They were definitely sizzling on page. There was a good connection that straddled the insta-love and insta-lust line. I especially enjoyed things from Nic&#8217;s POV. The way he looked and reacted to Justice really helped me understand what he was seeing in him. Justice was kind of a whirlwind character. He was all over the place. He was high then low. Strong then weak. Feminine and then masculine. I felt rung out just reading about him. I can&#8217;t imagine actually being in love with him. Complex character indeed.Some of the things that didn&#8217;t work for me were Justice&#8217;s panic attacks. I just didn&#8217;t feel his pain and fear. I know I read it but it just didn&#8217;t break that barrier where I&#8217;m right there in it with the character. So, I was just reading about Justice&#8217;s many issues and how they affected the people around him. I&#8217;m not the saint Nic is and became frustrated with Justice. Justice went from public displays of affection to not being able to walk in his friend&#8217;s wedding with Nic when that meant the world to Nic after his ex made Nic his dirty little secret. Came off as selfish and cruel. He did redeem himself in the end. I get the fact that he had to deal with his issues before he could really be with Nic but I don&#8217;t have to like it!Another thing that niggled with me was Nic&#8217;s dirty talk to Justice at some very inappropriate times. Justice was way back in the closet and for Nic to talk about pounding Justice into a mattress while in public almost seemed vulgar instead of sexy. I get that he was pushing him but it just seemed like too much. For the most part Nic was an amazing guy and I adored his character. This was my only issue with him.I kind of wish Rich&#8217;s character wasn&#8217;t so over the top. You understand where all the BS comes from by the end of the book but he&#8217;s just so unlikable. I have strongly disliked a character before and an author fully redeemed him in my mind and hopefully, if the next book is heading where I think it is, that happens. I did like Rory and my mind is already wondering about him&#8230;..

D. Ayers work is new to me but after reading Necessary Force, I will look forward to more in this series. I loved the idea of the K-9 Series so I had hoped this would be good. I was wrong it is great. For an introduction to the series, it starts right in with the characters and their relationship. I like romantic suspense and this novella had all the elements of mystery, suspense, danger, secrets and romance. It is short; I read it on one evening but finished with the story having a feeling of completeness to it. I will admit that I had figured out the villain by half way through reading the story but that was okay since the journey of catching him was very satisfying.One of my favorite characters is the FBI Bomb sniffing dog, Zander. The connection between Zander and his handler, Brad, seemed real and was enlightening in the world of the K-9 units. I wondered how much research Ayers must have done to give this story such an authentic feel to it.  At the same time, by no means did Zander steal the limelight from Brad or Georgia, his part in the story was well played.I haven&#8217;t know many photographers like Georgie but her approach to her work was interesting. She and Brad were sweet and steamy together; which is a hard act for an author to pull off. By the end of the novella, I was hoping that the third time meeting in the park would be a charm they needed for a HEA.I can recommend Necessary Force to those who enjoy suspense with their romance.

I love older-brother's-best-friend stories (why my parents only gave me a younger brother I will never understand), as well as childhood crushes all grown up and back with a vengeance, so this story was like catnip for me. Or would Beckynip be a better description? Either way, it was a guaranteed win.Add to that Celia's propensity towards wearing novelty work-related t-shirts (Veterinary Medicine: Because People are Gross) and the most brilliant t-shirt related proposal scene ever (the fact that it's the only t-shirt related scene I know of is irrelevant), and you'll understand why I'm typing this review while literally giving the book two thumbs up. It's not easy, but totally worth the sacrifice.The chemistry between Celia and Jonah absolutely sizzles in this book--so much fun to read! You could feel her frustration at wanting to be seen as a grown woman by the guy she worshiped as a kid as well as his shock at finding her all grown up--and the hands-off-she's-Zach's-sister vibe that came along right behind it. It all made for some delicious tension, especially since circumstances kept putting them together.Circumstances, and some fabulous secondary characters.Des, Celia's almost-sister-in-law, played a part, giving our heroine a much-needed push into the girl zone after years of trying to blend in with the boys. Even if nothing sticks beyond the pretty underwear and girl-sized jeans, she will have accomplished much, as I'm sure Jonah can attest.But my favorite secondary character here is Anne-Marie, Jonah's paralegal. She alternately tries to mother and bully him into becoming the man she knows he can be, attempting to fix him up with dates when she's not trying to guilt him into helping out at a local camp for at-risk children. Fully half of the passages I highlighted in this book had her in them, like this one:She stood up abruptly, took a small step forward and slapped him on the face, not so hard as to leave a mark, but hard enough to give him a jolt.&#8220;Wake up, Jonah! Love doesn&#8217;t come with the risk of pain. It carries a guarantee of pain. Of course, you&#8217;ll hurt each other. Then you&#8217;ll force each other to change and grow into better people. You&#8217;ll become stronger, and more vulnerable at the same time. She&#8217;ll have more power over you than anyone else in the world and she&#8217;ll also make you feel like the greatest man who ever lived.&#8221;&#8220;She already does.&#8221; Instantly, the pressure in his chest eased. It felt like a dam had burst, a plug had been pulled, a wall breached.Anne-Marie pulled him to his feet and hugged him, hard. &#8220;There.

You can love her all you want, but it&#8217;ll have to wait until after Des and Zach&#8217;s wedding. What does the best lawyer in Lutherton have to say about that?&#8221;&#8220;I&#8217;m the only lawyer in Lutherton.&#8221;&#8220;See?&#8221; She beamed at him. &#8220;Not so dumb after all, are you?&#8221;Love.

A millionaire with a successful property development business and a loner geek with a computer upgrading business squaring off over the sale of her property. He's slick, handsome and a bit under-developed as a character and she's a strange mix of stiff spined and gutless. Not gonna lie... I had a very difficult time liking these characters. When Will wasn't thinking about how tiny Kate is, she's thinking about how she's not going to sell... not because she grew up in the building&#8212;she didn't&#8212;or because she can't relocate her business&#8212;she could&#8212;but because of reasons.THE SEDUCTION GAME was one of those stories where I liked it in theory but wound up not digging it in actuality. It shows both my age and my true geek card that the basic jist of plot reminded me of the 80's flick, Batteries Not Included, which won it a lot of points. I liked the whole idea of Kate resisting selling her building to a big developer. What didn't really work for me was the threadbare character development.While Kate is fairly well developed as a character, the big reason she holds back on selling never feels valid, as if she's being stubborn for the sake of it. Meanwhile, Will is so under-developed beyond his business and a reference comparing him to actor Nathan Fillion, I never quite bought him as a romantic hero. I almost felt like he looked down on Kate (which might have a lot to do with constant references to how tiny she is) both socially and physically. Without a lot of back knowledge on his past, he just never seemed more than a caricature. I could get their physical attraction to a point but an emotional connection seemed contrived. Ultimately, while it wasn't an unlikable story, it just never quite had the warmth I was expecting where the geek gets the girl... or in this case, the guy.Having read both Indulgence titles and Shortt's WAKING UP DEAD, I think my lukewarm reception of the book has more to do with the genre than anything. Contemporary category romances can be hit or miss with me as a reader and as a geek, I have high expectations of a geek romance. That said, if you are a geek you'll enjoy the pop culture references and the nice change of pace from it being the hero who is a geek. Two thumbs up for representation! Not a geek?

I like a heroine who knows what she wants and goes for it.The second half of this book dealt with some very dark topics including the witch hunts that took place in Salem when fingers were being pointed at women for being witches and they were being hanged. I wish that there would have been more information added about this topic. I felt it was not used to its full advantage and a missed opportunity; it would have added so much more to the read. However, I liked reading how it all played out in the end.There was only one very sensual love scene and it was wonderfully written. I found myself wishing there would have been more steamy interactions between Josiah and Ann, because Sarah Balance certainly knows how to write a truly hot love scene. Yes, the sexual tension was high throughout, but I wanted more.There is a happy ending BUT, NO EPILOGUE!!

However, since the beginning of the book they both know each other's feelings and have no qualms speaking between themselves about it.The shadow of the witch hunts still looms throughout the story, though not as heavily as the first book, and plays, even if a minor part, and important factor in some of the choices the characters make.I think that by the end of the story what you truly learn from this story is that guilt has a way to manifest itself, in all kinds of forms, even to hinder the possibility of something beautiful to bloom. It also shows you how humane it is and how humans themselves are the ones that bring a meaning to it, illogical or not, everyone has their own way to cope with it.I also liked the cameo appearances of several characters from the previous book.If you are looking for a story with an uncomplicated and straightforward plot, with some romance, and honest characters this is the  book you should read.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Really liked it!", "unixReviewTime": 1397433600, "reviewTime": "04 14, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A2STRRBTJB9O1P", "asin": "B00J6UKC0S", "reviewerName": "Veronica Franco", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "Im So fortunate i got an ARC....and i loved Every single second of it...First of all I &#9829; u MS.

Remember Me is NOT a stand-alone book and to understand what&#8217;s going on you would have had to read the first two in the Shattered Series.In Always Me Garrith and Keisha had their problems actually in both books; however things were getting better between the two of them.  In all these books my book boyfriend is most definitely Sebastian and in Break Me it was made to look like he was killed.  He definitely was shot but Garrith being in the FBI needed Sebastian to take down Jose Alvarez and since Sebastian and Tori both were shot this was the perfect opportunity to get Sebastian hidden let everyone believe including Tori that he died. In Always me everything fell into place and Sebastian and Garrith took down Jose but not without collateral damage.  Keisha was shot and rushed to the hospital.The heart wrenching end was when Garrith visits Keisha and sits with her only to find out she has absolutely no memory of him whatsoever.In Remember Me you realize Garrith took a leave of absence from the FBI and for six months basically dropped off the face of the earth.  He was drowning his sorrows in alcohol.  He was so in love with Keisha this was killing him.  As you continue on with the read you learn a lot of things about Garrith and Keisha when they were younger.  Garrith has always been in love with her from the time they were teenagers.  During the teenage years something happened and Garrith was so afraid that if he started telling Keisha about their past she would hate him again and he didn&#8217;t think he could handle a 3rd break up.  As the story unravels Garrith ends up blurting information out and Keisha was trying to digest everything.  Sex seemed to be her trigger where bits and pieces would come back to her with excruciating pain.Ironically Keisha&#8217;s memory does come back after a bad accident she and Garrith were in.  Keisha so wanted to remember the man she&#8217;s always been in love with.  I don&#8217;t want to say much more, however I have to throw a few spoilers in.  Yay Sebastian and Tori get married, Tori is pregnant again.  HEA does come for Garrith and Keisha and OMG wait until you read Epilogue (which by the way happens 6 months later.).  Mathis is mentioned in this read.  He has a tendency of popping up in Jo-Anna&#8217;s books like seriously.  You find out a little teenie tiny bit about Lucas,  a friend of Sebastian&#8217;s so you can imagine how stoked I was to learn  Book # 4 in the Shattered Series will be about Lucas Crane and Lilly Benson.  I&#8217;m real curious in this next book where Mathis will pop up.

I didn't like the hero or the heroine the heroes father was the worst person in the whole wide world. It was nothing I thought it would be. I didn't connect with the hero or the heroine and just didn't care about them at all. I wouldn't say it was a romance at all. I didn't like the writing it didn't flow. If you like MC books I highly recommend that you stay far, far away from this book. I love MC books  but this one was just bad,bad, bad. The only good thing about this book was the cover. Please, please don't read any further if you don't want this book spoiled and when I say spoiled I mean almost everything about this book.SPOILERSthe heroes father molests the heroine when she is a teen and beats her, then when she is older and the hero and heroine get back together the MC president(the heroes dad) drugs her and sexually assault her with other club members (when she is the heroes old lady) the hero sleeps with a girl the heroine's brother likes and thinks she has the clap( and doesn't care?). the heroes dad has holes all over the place when the heroine is a teen and now and watches her shower and his son touch himself. the hero and his dad t*g t*am girls the hero is a member of the MC when he is a teen(that doesn't happen). I don't mind \"bad language\" but this was so over the top I just kept thinking shut up already the heroine was just nasty IMO. there is a member who likes acting like a baby he has diapers, and bibs and walks around the club in one scene with a bib and a pump on(yes that kind of pump). the heroine talks about all the things the doctors like at the hospital(sexually), she knows she is being watched on camera at work and lets the hero perform oral sex on her then, oh my gosh there was a camera there(yeah she just said she didn't care,then she did)END SPOILERSI could go on, and on with this book it was a mess from beginning to end.

It's an excellent and entertaining sequel to Those Poor, Poor Bastards.I have to admit that I'm difficult to please when it comes to western novels, but weird western novels are my kind of novels. In my opinion The Ten Thousand Things is - just like Those Poor, Poor Bastards - an excellent example of a good and entertaining weird western novel, because the authors know how to entertain their readers. To be honest, I was impressed by this novel, because it turned out to be an even better novel than its predecessor.Before I begin to analyze the contents of this novel, it's good to mention that it's recommendable to read Those Poor, Poor Bastards before reading this novel. In my opinion knowledge of the previous happenings is essential in order to fully understand what happens in this novel.Here's a bit of information about the story:In The Ten Thousand Things Nina Weaver and the people with her are riding the rails and fight against Liao Xu's zombies. Liao Xu is responsible for unleashing the horde of the deaduns and other creatures against them. He relentlessly pursues them, because he wants something from them...The Ten Thousand Things differs a bit from the first novel, because it brings more depth to the story. The first novel introduced the characters to the readers and now the authors begin to add depth and more details to the story and to the characters. For example, the authors reveal a few interesting things about Liao Xu and his past, and Nina begins to accept her abilities and experiences sexual awakening. The authors also tell what happened to James' family.Nina is a fascinating heroine, because she's almost like a female version of the male western heroes and rogues played by Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and other famous actors. Although she's a fighter and survivor, she's much more than that, because she has strange abilities that separate her from others. She has a spiritual connection to the People and the Land. She has slowly begun to change inside, because she hears the sounds of the People, their drums and flutes, and their whispers. The realization of this change rattles her, because she has to accept the changes.There are several excellent and thrilling scenes in this novel. For example, the attack of the birds is an impressive scene. Reading about Liao Xu's demon train is also memorable, because it adds a wonderfully otherwordly atmosphere and a malicious supernatural threat to the storyline.The prose in The Ten Thousand Things is surprisingly good (in the first novel the prose was good, but now it's even better). The authors have found the right kind of rhythm and  that they use to move the happenings forward. The pacing is also much better in this novel, because the story feels more balanced than before.One of the best things about this novel (and its predecessor) is that it's genuinely interesting to read about how Nina and the other survivors get along with each other. The authors have managed to write about this aspect of their survival in a surprisingly realistic way.The authors write boldly about sex and things related to sex. I won't reveal what happens in the story, but there's an explicit and passionate sex scene in the middle of the novel that has been written well.It's nice that there's also a bit of humour in the story. For example, the scene in which one of the characters has to drop his pants is a funny scene. I think it'll amuse several readers.Because I'm a Finn, I have to mention that it was interesting that the authors used one Finnish word and a few Swedish words in the story. These words surprised me, because I didn't expect to find Finnish and Swedish words in a weird western novel.It's possible that there are readers out there who think that this series is only about a fight against zombies. I can say to these readers that they're wrong, because the authors have created a story that tells of an epic and desperate fight between good and evil. There are - of course - plenty of zombies in this series, but there's much more to the story than them, because the fight between good and evil is the core of the story.Tim Marquitz, J. M.

It happens that the Chief Administator and the Head of Nursing are on vacation, leaving Alex and her ex-husband in charge, just as the novel starts out with a crisis in the ER or ED,--Emergency Department&#8212;where a victim has suddenly gone CODE BLUE. Clearly, Author Rocchiccoli knows what she is writing about, because the realism is too good to be faked. Within a few hours more victims arrive taxing the ED and the hospital to its limits. They must call in the CDC from Atlanta to assist in identifying a mysterious virus causing multiple victims and quick deaths. We suspect this is a bioterrorist attack by an extremist cell, hiding in &#8220;The Big Easy,&#8221; one of whose members has infiltrated the NOPD and another is a trusted grad student at Tulane&#8217;s scientific bioresearch center. But, even the cell members are not sure who caused the virus attack, as they mistrust each other, and suspect it is a double-cross by a Russian terrorist from Chechnia. All the branches of law enforcement converge on the city in advance of a conference including the President and 100 or so top politicos. Thus the NOPD, FBI, Secret Service, State Police, National Guard, the Mayor, and the Governor&#8217;s office are all a part of the security preparations. Meantime there is a gruesome murder of a promising politician, a friend of Alex&#8217;s family, which appears to be a serial murder. The plot spins on with Alex and her associates driven to near exhaustion as more sick are admitted and more bodies pile up. The author does a superb job of handling the technical and scientific aspects of the story, and of building the suspense to a crashing finish.This novel is timely, discussing the very real threat of hidden terrorist cells, bent on killing &#8216;infidels&#8217; and what they might do. Also, it discusses some of the highly technical ways that law enforcement has of scanning crowds and identifying threats.Highly recommended action/suspense/thriller.Dorothy May Mercer", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Timely, Explosive!", "unixReviewTime": 1400716800, "reviewTime": "05 22, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A3NGHZTCN9X6HB", "asin": "B00J7PC69C", "reviewerName": "jkaccinni", "helpful": [6, 6], "reviewText": "Rocchiccioli' Viral Intent is a true political/medical thriller, and is one of the best I have ever read!

I enjoy fantastical stories. I am a big fan of Alice, Narnia, and the wizard of OZ. I love the way children's minds can be opened whilst reading such tales. Having said that, I also believe that the writing has to be clear, uncluttered, and imaginative. Ms Stotzka manages to pen the right amount of tension, descriptive prose, beguiling words, and she maintains a steady pace, just right for kids and for adults, who do not let age interfere with a good story.The author brings to life characters and creatures in a wonderfully colourful way, yet she also brings forth a delicate subject, which highlights the relationship between mother and child.

Their looks are where their similarities end though.Ro is hardworking, diligent and constantly trying to better himself. He will be the first in his family to get a degree and puts all his time and energy into trying to make his landscape gardening business a success.Tony lives his life on the fly. His work ethic isn&#8217;t strong and he has become enamoured with a trainee Domme at his local BDSM club which takes up most of his time. When the club is looking for gay men to help with training he immediately thinks of his brother and offers him a way of making some much needed extra cash.Ro has no interest in BDSM and is definitely not submissive but needs the money and as he will be &#8216;subbing&#8217; for women who do nothing for him sexually he gives it a go. When Ro gets caught up in his day job and can&#8217;t make an evening session Tony grabs the chance to make his dream a reality but the consequences are disastrous.Lance has been working at the dental practice for almost 6 months. Charming, good looking and extremely smart on the surface he seems to have everything he wants. What Lance really wants and needs is a man to dominate but with his OCD and other quirks finding him has proven difficult. He has almost given up on the idea when Ro lands in his dental chair.Lance will go the extra mile to give Ro back his beautiful smile. Ro thinks Lance hung the stars but is pretty sure he isn&#8217;t gay and that if he was what would he see in such a lowly person as himself.  Both these men through their upbringing and previous events in their lives have major hang ups. Although they quickly get together and the sex is the best they have ever had they also connect mentally but there are so many secrets that their new friendship seems destined to fail.The big question is how two dominant men can be in a D/s relationship and when is the right time for Lance to approach his need for this. Ro feels panicked into coming clean about his foray into the BDSM scene but is terrified of how Lance will react and fears he will see him as a prostitute. The secrets just keep building.When Tony finally goes off the rails things quickly fall apart and Ro is left flailing and unsure of everything. Both these dominant men need to find a middle point, and quickly, if their relationship is to survive. For this to happen they will have to be truthful about everything for the first time since they met!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "~ Review by Caroline", "unixReviewTime": 1403136000, "reviewTime": "06 19, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A3GYDUI5KD2FOE", "asin": "B00J7SGI2A", "reviewerName": "M.

I haven't read this one yet, but it didn't really make Unholy Matrimony hard to read.  You can pretty much read it alone and not be confused at all.If you want a very funny murder mystery, then this book is for you.  I've never laughed so hard while reading one of these type of books before.  The book revolves around an Italian Catholic family. So that right there appealed to me and left me wanting to read it.  And yes this book is written in typical Jersey accents.  So you really feel like you are right there with the characters.The story starts out as Lucille trying to get her daughter, Bernadette, married before she has her baby out of wedlock.  No self-respecting Italian Catholic can do that.  So they find Bernadette a man, Taylor, that is willing to marry her, baby and all.  The problem with that is he doesn't like women.  So Bernadette would never have a happy, real marriage.  But she would be married before the baby was born, which is the objective.Well the morning of the wedding, the groom's mother,Donna, is found dead at the pulpit of the church Bernadette and Taylor are supposed to be married in.  And both Taylor and his father are missing.  Which leaves Bernadette without a husband after all. Which she is actually happy about because she was only marrying him to make her mom happy.The first person that they suspect could have committed the murder was Lucille herself.  She was the last person to have called Donna before she was murdered. And the person who found her dead.  So Lucille and her friend Flo go on a mission to find out what really happened to Donna, because no way is Lucille going to jail for something she didn't do.  She suspects it was Donna's husband Alex. Especially since he is no where to be found.  But as they start talking to more and more people, it seems like just about anyone could have done it.When the murderer is finally revealed, you really don't see it coming.  And especially for the reason why the person who killed Donna did it. It's not the reason you think at all.Oh and if you are wondering if they ever get a husband for Bernadette before the baby comes, well you will just have to pick up this book and find out.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very Funny Murder Mystery", "unixReviewTime": 1398297600, "reviewTime": "04 24, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A5PRFB22NF8LO", "asin": "B00J7SX8D2", "reviewerName": "Daniel", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "Even from just looking at the contents i knew this was the book i have been searching for.

I really liked it. A lot. The story is captivating and the characters are strong and well defined.Clay Mathers is a military consultant for the government and a writer in his free time and Pippa Sanders is a therapist and a single mother of twins. The moment they meet sparks fly.Clay doesn&#8217;t do subtle and Pippa doesn&#8217;t like his attitude. What they can&#8217;t deny is the mutual attraction they feel for each other.I really appreciated the fact that the author didn&#8217;t focused on the physical aspect. Yes, she mentioned how attractive and well built he is but that was just a part of his description and necessary for the scene. Instead, she focused on the interactions between the characters and their personalities. The lack of useless details was also very much appreciated. I hate it when I have to dig my way out through details like what they&#8217;re drinking, what they&#8217;re wearing, what type of car they&#8217;re driving and so on just to get to the story.The supportive characters are the same ones that we met in the first book, Cooking Up Love, maybe a few more but not so many as to create confusion or add useless drama to the story.The writing style is good and some of the dialogues are really funny.

My home is filled with many items that are unneeded that causes clutter and takes away from the actual house. How he describes the way people feel the need to stay with in what society or peers have or do affects their home. Many don't think about the extra work they spend in cleaning or how much dust the items they have collect or the health issues it may cause. Let&#8217;s also look at financial effects. Buying unneeded items to try and impress others or to maintain the cleaning produces and if you decide to move the expense or extra time it will take to pack a haul. Author Allen Francis helps by teaching you what things are needed verses what we just want and how both effect our home and how it looks. He goes as far as to go int the issues or financial issues that can follow. I know that based on what I have read I plan to take a good look around my home and get rid or rearrange what I have to help bring the beauty of my home to the front rather than hidden behind a bunch of things that are unneeded.

Sending Jack off to Jesus picks up where the last book left off with Jack now being under the watchful eye and threat of his tyrant of a father. In my opinion, Nathanial Miller should be the poster boy for family planning&#8230; and he has 10 kids... and a preacher to boot&#8230;Sorry about the rant. He has pulled the &#8216;if you don&#8217;t do as I say I will hurt your baby brother&#8217; card to Jack. See what I mean? So, Jack is conflicted. He wants to  hurry up and graduate, hoping for a scholarship so he can get on with his life and make a life for him and his boyfriend Andrew, but if he leaves he fears for Billy who at the tender age of 7 is very girly, and very proud of himself. Now I will talk about characters.I will start with baby brother Billy. For only 7 this kid is a dream. I absolutely love Billy and he deserves a story of his own (hint, hint). He is such a sweet thing, and confident.  In this book it is mostly Jack and Andrew but there i some scene with Billy that is a heart wrencher. I could just see him looking at awe at the photos of the two men and professing &#8220;How beautiful&#8221; then growling and yelling at his dad how ugly he is... yep the 7 year old is a scene stealer!  Jack is also a very great character. For only 18 he is one heck of a responsible boy.  I can say the same for Andrew. Both are fabulous characters. So I will say if you  like amazing characters as you can see here we have great main characters, supporting characters ( I didn&#8217;t mention Jacks mom she really steps up here and becomes a game changer) she is the epitome of character growth. (if Jack&#8217;s dad  sounds like meanie of the year you should get a load of Andrew&#8217;s dad he makes jacks dad look good.Ok, so let&#8217;s move on to the story. As I said it is a continuation of the last book and does end as a cliffhanger too, but if you&#8217;re a big Sara York fan you know what to expect.. nail biting suspense!! This story is full of angst, love, strong emotion and suspense. I cannot wait for the next.I highly recommend this if you like ongoing series that end in cliffhangers making you beg for  more, boundless love, spunky seven year olds, amazing character, sweet, but hot sensual mansex, stories that make you think, over-controlling parents,  and nail-biting suspense  and a heart-wrenching story.( be sure to have a box of tissue on hand)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Sending Jack off to Jesus", "unixReviewTime": 1395792000, "reviewTime": "03 26, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A2WWLU2R30IL8C", "asin": "B00J833X3G", "reviewerName": "Holly \"Holly's Red Hot Reviews\"", "helpful": [4, 4], "reviewText": "This was a great start to this serial.

It is triple rewarding when you are finished (which was accomplished in a day) left well sated for a minute mind you because you know must read the next one in this series. Emma was such a wonderful character that this author has breathed to life that starts you on a wonderful journey. Being a single parent myself could connect with her on sacrifices she made to raise her sister. But now her sister has met the man of life and it is Emma's time in a way too. Time to choose something for just herself and immerse herself in it. Laurie has set her up on a date but also to meet others along with her boyfriend Rob. Jake has agreed but goofs up right off the bat, delightful scene by the way. This town is similar to what I grew up in so it made this so easy to connect with the talent of this author. They are all surprised at how young she still is but then she tells their story. Jake is quite the man also-alpha through and through. Takes care of his mom also and does not view it as a burden, a man after my own heart. Being a detective also is quite the career of a man I enjoy reading about. So when she mentions the house she is to look at and maybe buy he is not about to let her go alone because it has been vacant for quite awhile. It just so happens later that evening he appoints himself her protector even when she says she can take care of herself. Sheesh glad there wasn't any arguments there. So this author has definitely hooked you by now and not letting go but where would you go it is so good. Their relationship builds filled with heat that if it was any hotter you would burn your seat. Little occurrences start happening that create intrigue which is another plus this book has to give. Fast pace with a wonderful flow that when you find out all the why's and who done its that is where the man this was wonderful comes in. A must read to find out why it is that Emma is finally home and the wonderful characters introduced to and come to love.

She risks forfeiting her life to warn Brand of an impending attack but she doesn&#8217;t hesitate. Brand has her in his arms once more and he will never lose her again.I have waited a long time for this one. At last comes Mating Brand, the long awaited third book in Laurann Dohner&#8217;s Mating Heat series. I must say that it was well worth the wait.Brand is finally reunited with Charma in this book. Devoted readers will remember the lost love that he revealed to his cousins in the previous book. Curiosity had me anxious about what happened to tear them apart. Dohner didn&#8217;t keep me in the dark long. It was extenuating circumstances that led to their long seperation. Poor Charma. She can&#8217;t turn away again so she burns her bridges and rushes to warn her love of impending danger.I loved Brand and Charma together. I felt the story started off strong and kept up the intensity right up until the end. Brand was a hot alpha hero who didn&#8217;t waste any time claiming his mate this time around. They make up for lost time in the bedroom too. There was a great deal of conflict in the story because they are supposed to be natural enemies. The plot was riveting with plenty of action when the big pussies attack and lives are in danger. Okay !!! I couldn&#8217;t help myself. *grin* It was well developed with family bonds and Pack dynamics being explored. All the characters were intriguing and, and yes, I need to read everyone&#8217;s story. Especially Rave and Von.It was no surprise to me that this book was very well written. It was put together quite nicely with a solid plot while at the same time being deliciously dirty. It was an engaging and fast paced read. I read it in one sitting because I didn&#8217;t want to put it down. Now, I&#8217;m really hoping there will be more books in the series, and that I won&#8217;t have to wait so long for the next one.I happily recommend this book.

This book should not be read alone, but second, otherwise the reader will miss out on the entire back story.This book focused more on the relationships between the characters. We have conflicts between family, friends, Jackson and Jocelyn&#8230; pretty much anyone that could cause harm to their fairly new bond. There were some conflicts that seem will never resolve, that really hurt my heart right along with Jocelyn. The author was amazing at making me feel right along with the MC, her feelings bled off the pages until they became mine as well. And man did she go through a nonstop complete emotional roller coaster. The one big issue I had with the MC is the fact she was already letting her grades slip. Everyone, including herself was so concerned about her getting pregnant and not finishing school, yet her lack of effort right now was never an issue. Most nights she would not do homework because she was with Jackson or researching her own history. I wanted to shake her a little. And can I just say that I felt it was a little old fashioned that everyone didn&#8217;t want her to marry because she would get pregnant. You don&#8217;t have to married for that to occur, just an FYI. There may be other elements present in this book as well, but the main idea is that this is a romance. Their relationship is at the heart of every action, be it in the past or the present. Jackson and Jocelyn are so very upfront about their feelings, not only too each other but to everyone else as well. At times I felt a little awkward reading this because it was like getting an intimate peek into a private moment that really could have been kept private. It was nice that they felt so strongly for each other, but they were both so intense about it. Also, is it that easy to fake being a high school student? I thought documentation such as a social security number were needed for things like that.I liked that the walls are breaking down between the two times, but I feel like she is so impulsive that something terrible is bound to happen. Also, I believe that both Jocelyn and Jackson overreacted in the most epic of proportions, both at fault in my view. I got so emotionally attached to these people that I need the next book as soon as it becomes available because I am on the edge of my seat.

A hot sexy encounter in a quiet area of the train, with a rugged, gorgeous stranger with magic hands. A far cry from her normal behaviour, which is much more reserved and demure than her profession suggests. Which is probably why she decides to use her pen name, Autumn Winters, instead of her real name....Enjoying the freedom of not being measured by the size of his wallet, Hunter Grayson decides to  keep some secrets of his own, determined to enjoy the gorgeous and passionate Autumn as long as he can. But when those secrets come to light, before he has a chance to explain.....Autumn has disappeared.*****YOWZA!! That is most definitely one hot little number!!A highly erotic story bringing to life a popular 'secret' fantasy of many, I'm sure! Impulsive sex with a stranger in a semi-public location..... Just like for most of us, for Olivia a fantasy was all it had ever been. Except in her case, she would write about them too. But this time she challenges herself to step outside her own box - to be in the moment, so to speak. Grabbing an opportunity to expand on her experience and explore her own limits, something she feels she needs after a bad break up. She is surprised to find herself far more passionate and lustful than she had imagined. Or maybe that was Hunter's influence.....Not used to being looked at for who he is, but mainly for what he represents, Autumn's refreshing innocence and direct honesty is new to Hunter. He is tired of phony smiles and fake orgasms and craves real and natural responses, like the ones he evokes from Autumn. His lack of trust is a result of history and experience, but it almost costs him a chance to pursue what he has craved all along.If you are looking for page-scorching love scenes..... You've found it. But there is not a whole lot to the story. I know, it is a novella, there isn't a lot of book to explore backgrounds and context and a whole lot of depth to go with the sex, but I still missed it a bit. What there was....was undoubtedly well written, there just wasn't enough and it was a little too 'pat'...too easy, in the end.

I couldn&#8217;t put the book down! There are many Werewolf/Vampire books out there today and they won&#8217;t stop coming, but when you can put originality to it and spin it so that its not the same as all the others you have something great!After a tragic incident that leaves Sara alone and without a family for many years moving from place to place she ends up at a bar back in the state of Kentucky, the state she once called home. However, now she is grown and taking care of herself although still experiencing nightmares of that horrible night and wondering why Jarroth, a boy she grew up with never came for him as he promised he would.  That same night at the bar Sara is attacked by vicious men and rescued by a stranger. When she comes to and calms down a bit this stranger turns out not to be a stranger at all, but the boy she has thought to be dead all these years, Jarroth.  However, Jarroth is no longer a boy, but a very sexy and strong man! Not only that, but he isn&#8217;t quite human and Sara soon finds out that the myths about Werewolves and Vampires are indeed real.Loved, loved, loved the chemistry between Jarroth and Sara. I love how he said he was going to wait for her to answer before they went any further than simply kissing or such, but still pushed her at the same time. I love the protectiveness he has over her and being that he thought she was dead all these years and then finding her and not wanting to every let her go is just&#8230;.ugh..can we say swoon!Having been on her own pretty much since she was about twelve she is very independent, but can recognize when she needs help or protecting. At the same time she trys to act as if she doesn&#8217;t know if she can be with Jarroth and be his mate and perhaps make that commitment, but deep down inside she knows that it feels right! Once she comes to that conclusion she gives in especially after another run in with those same vicious men that attacked her the night before. This gives her the opportunity to see all of Jarroth and what he is capable of and the he would indeed lay his life down in order to protect her.Yes the book leaves you hanging in the worst way, but cliffhangers aren&#8217;t always bad if they make you want to continue you on with the next book!

With a new heart, Abby's life has stopped being about hospitals, sickness, and dying and started being about experiencing all the aspects of life she was never able to because of her condition.  What better way to let go of the old her and embrace the new her - the one with a bright future full of limitless possibilities - than a road trip! And this is where Abby's story/journey takes an interesting turn - Enter Beckham Dilan Prescott. Beck takes Abby on the road trip of a lifetime. Beck is just what Abby needs; he shows her what it means to enjoy life and be ever present in her life for the first time in a long time.With this Heart is an amazing story about truly living for yourself...owning the life you've been given and never regretting your decisions. Abby is the perfect heroine for this coming of age story; at 19, she has little life experience, so she lights up with every new situation. Through all the highs and lows, readers are right there with Abby, laughing at her banter and crying with her when she has set backs. R.S. Grey gives us a front row seat on Abby and Beck's adventure, and I loved every minute of it.Abby couldn't have asked for a better co-pilot on her journey. Beck has to be one of the sweetest book boyfriends I have ever met. He's romantic and caring; he gives of himself so freely, which is exactly what Abby needs as she tries to figure out the kind of life she wants to live.This is a must read book; it definitely runs readers through the gamut of emotions, but in the end, no matter how many tears are shed, the payoff comes with the most amazing ending.

They were normal, everyday people; Lea a college student and Colby an aspiring musician. The story had a very natural flow that was nice for a shorter book. Nothing felt rushed or forced in anyway.A lot happens and is resolved in this short story, but it does end on a cliffhanger with new questions that are left unanswered. It was packed with emotion and endearing moments that can only be shared by two people who know each other inside and out.I would happily read the next story in this series. It was a great read for an easy afternoon. I look forward to learning about the next chapter of Lea and Colby's lives.I give this book 4 stars and would pair it with a hard lemonade.This book was generously provided in exchange for an honest review.Read more of our reviews and book/drink pairings at [...]", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Sweet novella left me wanting more", "unixReviewTime": 1396310400, "reviewTime": "04 1, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A3A2MUZQLCGA0T", "asin": "B00J9U5VSS", "reviewerName": "JSantoro1302", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "Great quick read.

Afraid To Love focuses on Ana and follows the same timeline as Fire. It is not a sequel, and you do not have to read one to enjoy the other, but the two books do compliment each other well. I liked Fire In His Eyes, but found some of the writing to be a bit off, even though I still gave it 4 stars. But the author's writing has really improved in Afraid To Love.Afraid To Love tells the story of Ana, who has had her heart broken once before when her ex-husband cheated on her. That would have been bad enough, but to make things worse he also brought into their marital bed a serious STD which ended up causing Ana to have a complete hysterectomy at the age of 24. She is now 34, and for the last 10 years she has limited her exposure to men to one night stands and such. Ana never wanted to get serious with another man, worried that he would also break her heart. She also felt that she was only half a woman now that she could never have children of her own. What kind of man would ever be satisfied with that?Everything changes the night she met Teddy. Teddy was a handsome bartender who swept Ana off her feet like no other man had before. For the first time in many years Ana wanted to see a man more than once. And Teddy wanted to see more of this beautiful red haired goddess. Almost in spite of herself, Ana was falling in love with this incredible man. But she knew nothing serious could ever come of it. Teddy was from a large family, and she knew he wanted kids of his own someday. She could never give him that.However, Teddy had secrets of his own, and this is the crux of the novel. How can these two, who obviously care for each other, possibly be together and enjoy their happy ending? Please read this book to learn the answer to that.The sex scenes in this book are fire hot. Ana is very submissive in the bedroom, wanting a man to take control, and Teddy is more than willing to do just that. As a man myself I have to say I found that especially hot and sexy.The book is complete in and of itself.

I've no idea how I found this one but I did pay full price for it so I'm entitled to this review, no matter how many unhelpful votes I get. Once again there were only 5 star reviews so I should've been more cautious. The premise of the story is that the H meets the h, when he goes to see who his brother is intending to marry. He makes a load of assumptions about her and decides that the only way he can prevent his younger brother from making a huge mistake, is by marrying her himself and then annulling the marriage after his brother has found someone more suitable. I found the story melodramatic, the interaction between the main characters was awful and immature and full of misunderstandings and presumptions. The main characters themselves were unlikeable. The name-calling was supposed to be cute, I think, but it really got on my nerves. This goes on for the whole book and when there is yet another drama towards the end, I just wanted to throw my Kindle and be done with this book.+++Spoilers+++One of the very many examples of the problems I had with this book, is when the H decides, after consummating the marriage, to give the h back to his brother.I cannot recommend it, I'm sorry.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Unpleasant", "unixReviewTime": 1397520000, "reviewTime": "04 15, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A2GF0RT6DYA9WH", "asin": "B00JA703JC", "reviewerName": "Beverly Greene", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "I love her books.

When he frees her...her anger is suddenly changing into desire, but she knows her past is unworthy of his love.Fatal Desire is the second book in the Guardians series by Valerie Twombly. This was a good fast paced, action packed story full of desire and lust. The leading characters Caleb and Lileta are pitted against one another right off the bat, but when danger comes knocking at their door Caleb releases Lileta of her slave bands to free her and keep her safe. The lust and desire these two felt for one another was palpable and jumped from the pages. I enjoyed their story and the story plot that flowed from the first novel.

I thought Ryke would be to mature for her, but he's a little dare devil himself so they were kind of a perfect match :) I LOVE RYKE! We got to see another side of him in this book. Jealousy? I was a bit surprised by it at first. There were some great scenes and some awkward ones as well (That one with Connor! I almost died with embarrassment for them!) I loved the connection that the two shared. I liked that we saw them build a friendship throughout the series and now we finally saw them get together. But it wasn't a smooth ride. With Daisy being the youngest, Ryke had to go through a lot of people. Lo being the first and he played no games.I liked that played the overprotective brother role. It made the anticipation that much better. I love the brotherly bond that Ryke, Lo and Connor have. Bromance is what people call it?

I know.. I can't believe it either. I struggled with this truly I did. I rated Hothouse Flower only 4 stars! WHAT!? Every other book in the series has gotten 5++++ from me but surprisingly for me Hothouse did not come with the same bang bang pow as the other books in the series.What I liked:I loved how the authors continued to update us on the other couples in the book. I love Richard Connor Cobalt so having his crazy funny sense of humor in this book was great. It was also wonderful to keep up with Lil and Lo and see what was going on with those two. I enjoy how this series although about sisters they are all three very unique and have their own lives, faults and wants. The authors do a really good job at showing this growing sister bond between the Calloway girls while also allowing them to have their own personalities.What I didn't care for as much:And basically why this book only got a STRONG 4 star rating from me.Unlike the other stories in the Addicted seres I did not feel like Ryke and Daisy stood out in their own book. Hothouse was supose to focus on their relationship but I felt like there were so many outside forces that the bond/love that these two share is there but I didn't feel it. When the two enemies Connor and Rose became one even as much as they tried to deny it, we as readers could feel it. When Lilly was out with other guys and Lo was being a mess at the end of the day in their dysfunction you could not deny their love.Now in Kiss the Sky the sexual tension between Ryke and Daisy was STRONG wow I could feel it. So I just KNEW Hothouse was going to be a ride. But other than the motorcycles that bang bang pow that I was expecting to feel between Ryke and Daisy i just didn't. Yes their together, have amazing HOT sex and love each other but outside of reading it on my ipad I didn't feel it. Every time there was an opportunity to expand and show how real their love/connection was it would be short changed by something going on between another character/relatiosnhip in the book.Would I recommend this book (series):YES The Addicted Series by Krista & Becca Ritchie so far is my favorite read of 2014. If that doesn't tell you READ ME I dont know what else will. Even though Hothouse didnt get a full 5 rating from me. It is still a good read and I am probably just being too nit picky.

Britton \"C. Britton\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "Fix You is the first part of Bash and Olivia's story in Christine Bell's new McDaniels Brothers series. This is the first of three parts for Bash and Olivia, and I thought it was a great way to start the series. I am already looking forward to getting more of these characters and can't wait to see what happens next. I must admit that I am not a huge fan of these short stories and serials because I am always left wanting more and I hate waiting. That being said though, this story was definitely worth the read and I am really glad that I took a chance on this one. I will just have to try and be patient as I wait to find out what happens next.At first glance, Olivia's life looks perfect. She is attending college at a good school, she comes from a well off family, and she is dating a boy she has known for years and was friends with before. But the truth is her family is struggling to make their mortgage payments and she knows that they are hiding something from her. Also, her boyfriend Andy has been drinking more and has been angry a lot lately. When she goes to a bar before spring break with Andy and her friend Echo, she ends up falling and is caught by a handsome bar employee. The attraction between them is instant and both of them feel drawn to each other. But Olivia's boyfriend Andy sees the whole thing and it sets him off. Sebastian (Bash) rushes in to save her from Andy's temper before he gives her a beating that he is on the verge of. When Olivia decides to stay home from the spring break trip to Cabo that Andy and Echo are going on, she goes to the bar to apologize to Bash. Both of them feel the connection, but with so many things standing in their way they know the best thing to do is to walk away. But when you feel a connection that strong it isn't always that simple.I really liked Bash. He was such a great guy. Strong and protective, and willing to stand up for a girl he didn't know because it was the right thing to do. He knew that there would be consequences, and even when it ended up hurting him he still felt like he had done the right thing. He also continued to talk to Olivia and help her despite knowing that he should walk away for both of them. I liked that he was willing to help teach her how to protect herself and that he was always looking out for her. Olivia was smart and she was really kind. She felt so bad for how things had played out with Bash for his helping her and she tried to make things right. She also tried to see the best in Andy, and believed that because of their friendship she could try to get him the help he needed. I really liked her quirky awkwardness and the fact that she tended to ramble on while trying to talk to Bash. It was pretty funny and kind of adorable. I felt like she was so real and that I could relate to her because she seemed like just a cool girl that you would want to hang out with. I loved her and Bash together, and they had so much chemistry right from the start. You could really feel the tension between them and it was clear that it was only a matter of time before things exploded between them.Overall, I thought that this was a really great way to start the series and I enjoyed reading it despite it's short length. I liked Bash and Olivia a lot and I also thought that Bash's brother Matty was great as well. I am really looking forward to getting to know him better also. I did think that there was a lot of obstacles stacked against these two and I really hope that Andy gets what he deserves. I couldn't stand his character right from the start and he ended up being even worse than I had imagined. I liked that this story gave us both Bash's and Olivia's POVs. It was nice to see how both of them were thinking and feeling and I think it really gave the story depth considering the length. I feel like we already know Bash and Olivia really well even though we have just scratched the surface with them. I can't wait to read more in this series, and I think that Christine Bell has done a great job with introducing these characters. I recommend checking this one out if you are a fan of NA reads and are looking for something different. Luckily, the next installment isn't too far off because I need to see where Bell will take the story next!**Complimentary Copy provided by Author**", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great series starter!

There's a few things I probably did differently than you.Number 1, first and foremost, I'm a HUGE Christine Bell Fan. I've officially read everything she has released. I love her writing style and because of this I'm bound to NOT hate this book.Number 2 (and probably most importantly) I waited until the entire 3 book series was released. Then I downloaded Book One for Free, Book Two for $2.41 (ish) and Book Three for $.99That makes my entire purchase $3.40 which is, if you ask me, a VERY decent price for 250+ pages.Yes this is a series. No you probably don't like waiting. So don't. Don't start reading until all the books are released.The gripes about serials isn't so much about the money and more about how readers don't like waiting. I get you. I don't like waiting either.Getting into the actual review....I really enjoyed this story. A LOT actually. It fleshed out over the course of three books and yes, if you read them as standalones, the story would probably stink. But I didn't and I really enjoyed it. I really enjoyed Bash & Olivia. The tensions between them was very real. The conflict between Olivia and Andy got to me on a core level. I know what abusive relationships look like and Christine wrote this one spot on.And I really really loved Bash. I'm not one for book boyfriends... but abs of steel and the ability to hold his own in a street fight? Yes please.I feel like Christine writes so many romance novels they should start to sound the same. But they don't. She has this magical ability to make each book unique to the core and I love that about her writing.I DID have a few gripes that make this 4 stars instead of five.1. Editing. OMG. What happened? There were a TON of errors in these books. A lot of repeated words. Maybe an upload error? I don't know.. but it was pretty standard across all three books.2. The ending. I felt the ending was a BIT rushed and the fact that I needed to read the intro to Matty's story to get what had REALLY happened kind of through me. But I'm holding out judgement because I feel like the next story could probably fill in a good amount of holes.3. I wasn't sure about the character development. I finished the series feeling a little bit like I didn't know them well enough. Or maybe it's because I wanted to know them more. Maybe I didn't want it to end.

She was mentally abused by her ex-boyfriend whom she hilariously describes as a &#8220;deluded scrotclown&#8221;. The scars linger and effect her ability to not only form new relationships, but even to simply touch other people. Cait is supported by a wonderful cast of friends who add lots of life and laughs to the story. It's easy to sympathize with her struggles, while simultaneously rooting for her to get her head out of her ass.The plot doesn't fall victim to the usual cliches, and Cait's issues with self worth seem all too real. However, the books is a bit slow, and seems longer than the advertised 336 pages. At one point Cait says, &#8220;We've spent so long on the cusp of kissing that sometimes, I forget that we haven't.&#8221; I wanted to jump up and down and yell &#8220;Yes, I know. Now get on with it already!&#8221;  The author was making a point about Cait having trouble being touched, but the build up definitely drug on too long. The sex scenes were good once we finally got to them, but the explicit language was like a slap upside the head with a wet flounder because it was such an abrupt change from the page after page of earlier turmoil over even touching lips.The hero, Fist Candy - also known as Art, is a mystery for much of the book. He's the hot, new massage therapist whom Cait lusts after at work. When he returns her interest, she's shocked. Art has his own demons though, and his difficult history is revealed as their romance progresses. He's a true blue kind of guy though, and definitely qualifies as an upgrade in the boyfriend department.This review would not be complete without mentioning the cake. It's practically a character in the book. Most of the characters are students, and while their world should revolve around studying, it mostly revolves around cake and Instagram. Vanilla, chocolate, and everything in between are represented. If you make it through this book without falling victim to a cupcake, you're a better woman than I.

Her mother died years ago so it's just been Ella and her father, who has decided it's time Ella settled down and found a husband. Ella would like nothing more to find her true love, but so far she has found no one who sees beyond the family wealth to Ella.Until Sawyer. Perceived as the local drifter, there is a lot more to Sawyer than what meets the eye. What begins as a lark between Ella and her father to find a husband for her, soon morphs into something much more meaningful when Ella gets together with Sawyer. The sizzle is hot, the attraction immediate, and soon the two of them are getting to know each other very well. Both of them are falling hard for each otherSawyer's family has a skeleton in their closet though, and it's one of the reasons he has been afraid to commit, afraid to love anyone. Will this time prove differently though? When all is out in the open and needs dealt with, will Sawyer and Ella's new relationship survive it?I loved this novella by Kelly Hunter! Written with a perfect infusion of romance, humor, and a little suspense, Kelly draws you in to Ella and Sawyer's story and makes you hope they will have a happily ever after. The characters are strong and the feelings are real. Ella is strong, independent and she likes to be in control. Sawyer could be the perfect match for her...especially once she gets below the surface. Sawyer is open, he's not offering a lot of information up about himself and his past, but he's not hiding it either. He too wants acceptance for who he is, not what he has or what he's come from.

Kellen Coulter has grown up poor and has had a rough upbringing.  He&#8217;s a boxer but he also gets into street fights venting his anger that has been a part of his life for as long as he can remember. After being charged with Assault his attorney, Dan Monroe, takes him under his wing because he sees something of himself in Kellen.  Dan had grown up &#8220;on the wrong side of the tracks&#8221; himself but he worked his way up in life and through college and became a success and he wants to help young boys in similar situations.  So Dan has taken Kellen&#8217;s case pro Bono.  He believes that with help Kellen can stay out of trouble and make something of his life.Kellen begins to spend a lot of time at the Monroe household.  He quits getting into trouble with street fights and sticks to his passion, boxing&#8230;and he&#8217;s very good at it.  Dan and his wife Karen treat Kellen like a son.  The first time Kellen comes to see Dan; Dan isn&#8217;t home so Kellen ends up talking with Jenna, Dan&#8217;s 13 year old daughter.  They hit it off and end up talking for a while&#8230;both comfortable with each other&#8217;s company which is unusual for both of them.  But then Kellen meets Laney, Jenna&#8217;s older and stunning sister and he becomes attracted to her in a much different way.Kellen doesn&#8217;t act on his attraction to Laney because he doesn&#8217;t feel like he&#8217;s good enough for her.  But after spending a year hanging out with the Monroe family almost daily he finally asks Dan if he can take Laney out.This is the point in the book where things become complicated.  Although Kellen begins dating Laney he is still best friends with Jenna and Jenna is the only person he feels understands him.  Jenna also tries to hide her true feelings for Kellen.  She knows she&#8217;s too young to be with Kellen but it still hurts to see him with her sister who Jenna considers to be the ultimate beauty while she thinks of herself as being okay looking but certainly not able to compete with her gorgeous sister.One thing author Tracey Ward does throughout the book is jump ahead through time periods that would be unimportant to this story.  For example, she may go from present day to 3 months later.  I love that she does this because, as the reader, we don&#8217;t have to waste time reading filler to get to the time periods that are significant to the storyline.As time goes on Kellen who had been doing well with his life begins to become moody and depressed.  But we don&#8217;t really know why.  Ms. Ward keeps us in suspense as to why Kellen has changed when on the outside it appears that everything should be going well.  Kellen has finished college, has a great job and is engaged to Laney.  But there are some things going on behind the scenes that we don&#8217;t know about and we are left pondering what is going on.While following the life of Kellen we are also following Jenna&#8217;s life.  Jenna goes in a direction with her life that upsets her mom but her dad is happy for her and so is Kellen.  Jenna doesn&#8217;t fit into the high class social norm of the rich. She&#8217;s independent and real.Now that Jenna is an adult and out on her own she is still best friends with Kellen and I often wondered why Kellen was with Laney instead of Jenna.  But then again how do you break off an engagement with one sister so you can be with the other?  Quite simply&#8230;you can&#8217;t.But something major happens in Kellen&#8217;s life and he begins to re-evaluate everything he&#8217;s doing.  Will he finally realize that he doesn&#8217;t belong with Laney?  And even if he does realize he doesn&#8217;t belong with Laney will he do anything about it?&#8220;Knockout&#8221; is about learning lessons in life and deciding what to do once those lessons are learned.  Do you make hard decisions or take the easy way out?This is a standalone book&#8230;which I LOVE!!!  It also has a HEA.

I LOVED this series! The writing was engaging, sexy, steamy, and funny as hell at times. I loved its simplicity and its complexity. Each book had plot twists that kept me guessing and made sure I was never bored. Characters explored love, hate, faith, loyalty, and experienced romance, violence, and even death. Each character had their own bit of crazy or \"defect\", they weren't perfect and I loved that.This book was the culmination of the 'Rook and Ronin' serious. When all the past cons and lies come back to face the team they must fight to survive. Ronin still has Rook, Ford still has Ashleigh and Kate, and Spencer Shrike has ... no one, because he's keeping a huge secret from Veronica ~ Bombshell ~ Ronnie ~ Vaughn. He's lying to keep her safe. So he's pushing her away from him, putting up pretenses to keep her from getting involved. And it's breaking both of their hearts.I loved the flashbacks of the early days with Spencer and Ronnie:\"You will never forget this day, Veronica Vaughn. For the rest of your life, whenever someone asks you what the best day of your life was, this will be in your top three.\"***\"What about the other two?\" I ask.***\"We haven't made those memories yet, Bomb. But we will.\"Spencer has so much loyalty to the team and to Veronica that he puts them all before himself. And I got teary-eyed reading about his pain.\"Because, baby, I love you enough to push you away.\"Veronica is a feisty character who is very in love with Spencer. Almost to a fault, I think. He doesn't always treat her nicely or with respect, and I wanted her to kick him to the curb many times! I caught myself getting frustrated with her, and felt she almost bordered on pathetic. Not at all like her strong, assured self.\"See, this is why I need to avoid him at all costs. He deflates me. He sucks all my air out. He collapses me into nothingness.\"Major s*** comes to town that effects the team. Battles are fought. Love is made. Relationships settled. And I loved it. The wrap up was awesome!

The story centres around Dr. Rex Hudson &#8211; who makes a life  changing discovery deep in the jungles of Machu Picchu in Peru &#8211; and his twin daughter and son who inadvertently go along for the adventure of a lifetime when all three fall through a portal that takes them to Time Square &#8211; the central station of time travel.Dr. Hudson and his family soon learn that the removal of a strange obelisk from its resting place in Peru has triggered a series of events that may forever change the flow of time.  In fact, fractures in time have already occurred leaving time travelers stranded in unexpected and unknown locations.  It is up to Dr. Hudson, his children, and others at Time Square to return the obelisk to its resting place and to rescue the time travellers stranded across space and time.In a formula reminiscent of the Quest series, the author once again pens a thrilling roller-coaster ride of an adventure with a twist of time travel.  Readers dive right into the story as we come upon Dr. Rex and the other members of his search party as they are attacked by a band of poo-slinging, marauding monkeys.  The quick pace of the story grabs your attention from page one and keeps it until you turn the final page.  The author excels at keeping a young reader engaged by incorporating lots of action and witty dialogue between the quirky characters.  There are definitely many great one-liners that had me laughing out loud!I felt that the author hit the right balance in discussing the intricacies and complexity of time travel to the story.  There is just enough information to keep it interesting, but not enough to overwhelm young readers.  I loved the concept of a central station where a privileged few have the opportunity to travel back in time or to the future.  Sign me up!  The only comment I have is that I felt that the dialogue used among the doctor and his children in particular did not reflect the way people would speak in the 1930&#8242;s.  It felt more like the way kids today would speak.  The positive side of this is that children today could probably relate more easily to the children in the book because their language is similar.Time Square  |  The Shift is the first book in a planned series that will see the main characters moving forward with a number of sub-plots including finding and relocating the obelisk as well as finding and rescuing the stranded time travellers.  In short, there is a lot more story to be told and I&#8217;m coming along for that ride!My Bottom Line:Time Square  |  The Shift is a quick-paced adventure featuring a quirky cast of characters who frequently engage in witty dialogue; an intricate and suspenseful plot that will keep readers turning the pages; and plenty of humorous moments that will keep the reader entertained.  I recommend this series to middle graders who love time travel and a great adventure. Ages 8+* This book was given to me free-of-charge in exchange for my honest opinion.

While other ladies delight in fashion and local gossip, Verity is interested in mechanical gears and weapons. She's clever and ambitious and uses her creative mind to develop life-changing inventions. Of course, the credit for her brilliant work goes to someone else because her family would be ruined if the public ever discovered that a woman *gasp* was intelligent enough to do a man's job.I found it easy to fall in love with Verity's character in just a short amount of time and I have no doubt that she will only get more interesting from here.We're introduced to several other characters, one being the infamous McQueen that you'll find mentioned in the title. It's too soon to form a solid opinion of the American bounty hunter, but learning more about him is something to look forward to as the story continues.As the synopsis mentions, Verity's brother is kidnapped by vampyres and this is how the first installment ends.

I'm really bad about doing a knee jerk reaction and realizing I was too generous later on. But no. I finished this book two hours ago. Since then I've: made my boyfriend nearly late for work because of the tears, matted the cats fur because I held her sobbing, ate chocolate (I hate chocolate), and stared out the window for longer than acceptable. This book hit me right in the feels. Wow.This book sucked me in SO fast. Usually I read multiple books at a time because I have a hard time concentrating on just one, but not with this one. I think it's the mark of a crazy good book if it can keep my interest for 20% or 30% before I have to switch books. This one kept it the entire time. Last night, I started reading this. I only meant to read a few chapters to get a feel for it before passing out. Did that happen? Nope. I stayed up until 2am. I got to 80% in one night, y'all. That's bonkers. This morning, I voluntarily woke up earlier than normal to finish this book. The story has so many twists and turns. Brooklyn Skye is so good at building the suspense that makes you unable to put the book down. The need to know what's causing Ellie's blackouts and what's happening during them is fierce!I'll be honest. Gwen and Griffin were my OTP. Gwen had a lot of s*** she had to deal with. She was so raw and real. Both of the guys in this book were definitely romance material and sweet. But don't over-think that both word. There isn't a love triangle; at least not like you're expecting. I can't say much about the characters without giving it away. Just know that the characters and their stories are what made me enjoy this book so much.This is a story that feels really real. The characters seem real. The issues seem real. All of this stuff could legitimately happen, so it's bordering on frightening. Brooklyn Skye does an excellent job at keeping the pace and delivering this story perfectly.

Reeling from the breakup of the relationship with her first love, and at not even twenty, she firmly believes she's broken, unfixable.Until she wins a photography competition and finds herself in Dublin, and crosses paths with Shane Claymore, the owner of the guesthouse where she'll spend her month in Ireland. They strike sparks off each other right away, but he's got no time for anything but focusing on selling off the family business, and returning to his car racing career.Unfixable is Tessa Bailey's latest release, a spinoff from her compelling Line of Duty series, and her first New Adult novel. (While Unfixable spins off from Bailey's Protecting What's His, there is sufficient background for this novel to stand alone.)Willa's a superb character. Despite thinking she's broken she still has plenty of fire to her. The way she plays Shane at their first meeting is hilarious. Despite the way she thinks about herself, she's more than capable of deep love.Shane is a standout. He's a vintage dirty-talking, charismatic, sexy hero, for which Tessa Bailey is becoming quite well known, but what a complex character. Tortured by his relationship with his father, bearing the guilt of his death, there's nothing he wants more than to escape from the family legacy that weighs him down, and head back to the career he loves. Orla the barmaid says it best, in Unfixable: &#34;Irish men are a complicated sort...don't judge by what you see on the surface, or they'll knock you on your arse when you're not looking&#34;.Unfixable is a perfect blend of hot sexy and sweet love. We hurt for Willa and Shane as they hurt themselves and each other, cheer them on as they challenge each other and try to work out a way past their differences and the 'use-by' date that circumstances have placed on their relationship. But it's the growing past the beliefs you hold about yourself that keep you from moving forward, that's a real coming of age. Such good subject matter for this New Adult story, Bailey's first effort in the genre, which she handles skilfully.The setting is absolutely stunning and evocative, right down to the rendering of the Irish burr - it's like being there, walking along Baggot street hearing those voices yourself. The supporting characters are beautifully drawn, including Shane's family members. They're funny, caring, but never sink into clich&eacute;. They all have their own wants and desires, their own hidden pain.I highly recommend this book for readers who like their contemporary romance sexy, but like the emotional side too.Reviewer was given an advanced reader's copy as part of a fan giveaway in return for an honest review.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Tessa Bailey knocks it out of the park with her first New Adult novel, Unfixable", "unixReviewTime": 1397433600, "reviewTime": "04 14, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A7KLDKH92OP1W", "asin": "B00JD223TW", "reviewerName": "Lindy Gomez", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "My Thoughts:This was my first book by Tessa Bailey, and what a pleasure it was!  My co-blogger, Mikki, is the biggest Tessa Bailey fan, and has been telling me how amazing this author is.  Mikki and I have very similar reading tastes, so when she tells me something is amazing, I know that I am in for a real treat!Our main character, Willa Peet, is a strong, gritty, and independent female lead.  She had a tough childhood, with an absentee father, and a mother who was a heroine addict and prostitute.  She saw many things as a child that she shouldn't have, grew up in poverty, and learned how to survive.  Fortunately for her, she had an older sister, Ginger, who loved and protected her to the best of her ability.  Ginger ends up taking her away to live in Chicago.  Once Ginger meets Derek, a nice guy that works in law enforcement, the three of them become a close knit family.However, Willa never loses her sharp edges, and she knows that her past will always haunt her, and has partly shaped her to become the person that she is.  Willa's first boyfriend, Evan, was a good guy, who tried to change Willa in to a softer version of herself.  She got tired of seeing the pity, and disappointment in his eyes from when he repeatedly tried to change her, and didn't succeed.  Willa ends up breaking up with Evan, because she knows that he deserves someone very different from her, but she is heartbroken.  Willa has a passion and talent for photography, and when she wins a trip to Dublin, Ireland, in a photo contest, she knows this is the perfect opportunity to heal from her break-up.When Willa lands in Dublin, she meets Shane Claymore, the very sexy and moody owner of the Claymore Inn.  Right away these two share a very heated and feisty connection, and strong attraction.  Willa also meets Faith, Shane's younger sister, and Kitty, Shane's mentally ill mother.  Even though Willa doesn't plan to form any relationships or attachments in Dublin, fate intervenes!Wow, let me just say that Shane was super sexy!  I could picture his Irish accent, gorgeous blue eyes, and  brooding personality.  I loved all of the feisty banter between these two, as well as the intense sexual chemistry.  Once Shane set his sights on Willa, there was no helping that poor girl!  I loved the way these two grew as characters.  They were both a lot alike, in the fact that they had heavy burdens, shouldered guilt, and were very unhappy people.  When you peeled back the layers, it was obvious that they both were loyal to their loved ones, had huge hearts, and didn't see the good in themselves.  The more Shane and Willa actually got to know one another, the more they opened up, saw the good in each other, and healed.  I loved how the romance was slow-building and believable.  I was rooting for Willa and Shane to get a HEA together, and you will too.I loved Willa's relationships with Faith and Kitty as well.  Faith was sweet, loving, and wore her heart on her sleeve.  What you saw is what you got, and she really knew how to have a good time.  Kitty was mentally fragile, and often showed signs of dementia.  Willa grew fond of Faith as well.Unfixable was a character driven story.  Willa and Shane's conflicts had to do more with their individual inner struggles, and the fact that they wouldn't be in the same country in a month.  This may be my first story by Tessa Bailey, but it definitely won't be my last!  If you are in the mood for a great romance, full of passion,  read Unfixable, by Tessa Bailey!

Shane races cars and works with his sister to run the bar and keep track of their crazy but adorable mother.This book refreshingly refrains from following the same pattern as other books about girls coming from broken homes.

Of course there had been someone else, but Willa was determined this trip would heal her heart of that loss. She hadn't counted on the owner of the Inn she was scheduled to stay at, to be tall, dark and dangerously intriguing.Home to look after his sister and mother, as well as run their family Inn after the death of his father, Shane Claymore has had to take a hiatus in his racing career. Something he missed every day, and couldn't wait to get back to, but not without putting things in order for his family. He had it all planned out, and then the moody girl from the photo contest had to come and unsettle him.Like oil and water, at least that's what it looked like when Shane and Willa went at it. Constantly at each other, or throwing hard glares. Underneath all that animosity was a slow scalding heat that was steaming to the surface and once it found even the slightest crack, nothing could hold back the full-fledged combustion. Realizing their attraction only complicates matters.Each have baggage to contend with, timelimits to honor, people to consider and futures to plan....****Surprised!!! Very excellent!!A bit of a dark and angsty new adult story, but with great 'bite'.Tessa Bailey does a phenomenal job creating an atmosphere that is very tangible, both with characters and description. I could walk into Claymore's and would recognize it and its patrons right off. Perfectly set 'in scene'!The characters are wonderful!! Not just the two main characters, but all of the supporting cast as well, with a rich variety, each written with great care for individuality and personality. Often with quirky overtones and a great deal of spunk, but some with a tragic-comedic flavor.Willa herself is a little tragic. Tough as nails and sarcastically funny on the outside, she hides a mountain of insecurity, evidences by her past attempts to change herself into something she though someone else would want. Such low self value, although it doesn't seem that way from the chip she has on her shoulder. Shane seems to be able to see right through her, though.Shane is weighed down by guilt and responsibility, as well as lingering anger over past events he can no longer do anything about. At war between the desire to follow his dreams and the need to look after his family is wearing him down, making him bitter, lashing out at the flippant Willa.

Will follows his fellow pirate &#34;sister&#34; and her new husband to the Highlands (hiding out from King Henry). He meets the lovely lass Jonet. Still healing from her late husband's bad behavior Jonet takes care of the orphans of the clan. Without giving too much away, she and Will (who also saves children from the slave traders) are thrown together when a sickness hits the area. They travel to Clan Munro and take care of the children there.  I love these characters, most are back from the Highland Hearts series. The story flows nicely with barbs directed at Will, and I was surprised to read how Will handles it all. You learn Will can take a lot and even laughs at himself. I found myself loving Will (who was kind of a pain in Tangled Hearts).  He is funny yet very serious when it comes to Jonet. You will really enjoy this book. I love the way Heather ties in the dragonfly birthmark (Dragonfly Chronicles)...and sets up her next novel about Searc. I really enjoy finishing a book and moving on to the next family member.

So, when she learns that the Upper Crust Bakery chain is opening a new store opposite, she is concerned about the effect it may have on her business and is prepared to tell the boss&#8217;s son, exactly whats she thinks of him and his business practices.Liam Sinclair has never questioned the decisions his father has made for their company, The Upper Crust Bakery chain is successful and he is proud of the role he has had in growing it, but he&#8217;s never given much thought to the competition, until the moment the owner of Four-Leaf Clover literally falls into his arms. Still, no matter how attractive he finds Clover, business is business, with no room for the personal touch until Clover shows him that the bakery, and his life, is missing a vital ingredient &#8211; heart.Four-Leaf Clover by Charmaine Ross is set in the leafy suburbs of Victoria&#8217;s Dandenongs Ranges. Told from the perspectives of Clover and Liam, it is a sweet romance that proves the old adage that opposites attract. Liam is wealthy, carefree and a representative of &#8216;big business&#8217; while Clover is plagued with debt and responsibility and believes in a philosophy of people before profit. They should be enemies but from the first moment they meet, when Clover topples from a ladder into Liam&#8217;s arms, the attraction between them is undeniable.Ross does a good job of building on the physical attraction that sparks between her characters. The obstacles to their relationship are believable, from Liam&#8217;s past heartbreak and his father&#8217;s interference to Clover&#8217;s pride and her legitimate concerns regarding Liam&#8217;s motives. Their intimacy doesn&#8217;t feel forced as they get to know one another, despite the compressed time frame.I would have liked a few more scenes set in the cafe perhaps (maybe even the inclusion of a recipe) and for the confrontation between Liam and his father to have been fleshed out a little more but in general, I think the storyline is well thought out and believable.The dialogue is authentic, though the prose is sometimes a bit awkward.

The cover, to me, screams adult book.  The blurb says YA.  The story had me confused between middle grade and adult.  Why?  I'll tell ya.The book is set in Australia and I will admit to cultural differences.  Not so much that I didn't get things, just enough to give me pause a few times.  It might explain my biggest issue with the book.  I'm not sure what high school students are like at a private school in Australia but I do know what high school students from a public school are like in the US.  And this isn't like it.  The relationships screamed middle grade to me.  Yet at the same time, Jaz is dealing with adult issues.  I was just really confused and uncomfortable with it.Jaz is a strong girl that kicks behinds and asks questions later.  She brings the hurt.  She's very drawn to weapons and fighting.  She's also in love with her best friend, though he's oblivious.  She's also involved with &#34;running&#34; the ring (a gym) while the owner is out of town.  I found this strange.  She's been working there since she was 10.  It felt too convenient as a plot element. When Ryan shows up at the ring, he gains her attention with his muscles and good looks.  He's in his mid twenties, which didn't go with her age of 17.  Their connection made the book feel like NA.  It was very confusing.I really liked Taylor and Anna despite their flatness.  There was a lot of potential with them that I don't think every was realized.I guess that's how I felt about the whole thing.  There was potential there.

In this romantic mystery, Sebastian Alder survived Waterloo, barely. As he recovers, a woman appears to inform him that now, he is Lord Somerton. Removed to better chambers and an increased hope of actual recovery, he finds the legacy a great deal more trouble than it seemed to be worth.\"The Somerton inheritance was a tainted privilege. In some ways he was no better off than he would have been if he had remained a penniless officer of the line on half pay. At least then he only had his siblings and himself to worry about. Now he had a household and an estate, all claiming pennies from a purse that looked decidedly the worse for wear.... Where had it all gone and how, in God's name, was he expected to restore the family fortunes?He had thought the matter through in the tedious hours in the coach and decided that if he thought of the task ahead as being akin to a sudden promotion to Colonel of a regiment, it did not seem so daunting.\"Sebastian meets the new family, assumes his new responsibility and intends to make provisions for his brother and sister. As soon as he untangles the financial mess Anthony Kingsley left behind. There are hanger's on, wise granny, an aunt and dozens of cousins, plus tenants, retainers and servants to assess and get to know. Always near by, ready to offer assistance or subtle guidance, is Isabel. He sees her wounds, the grief she struggles beneath and that she is trying to reach beyond the sorrows and anger. Through Sebastian's eyes we observe Isabel's healing steps, stumbles and set backs. It was an interesting perspective because generally the socks are on the other foot.This story is slightly Gothic in tone, the writing smooth and gently reflective. There was an old-fashioned pace I really enjoyed. There was no rush of the romance, the story or the ending. The dialog kept you in the period without effort or cliches. Characters were believable, though slowly revealed. Personally I like that but others may find the bits and pieces revelation too old skool. Secondary characters weren't two dimensional though the villains were both over the top once their disguises were stripped away. I was disappointed by the second villain's big reveal. For all the realism it brought to the story, I felt manipulated and a wee bit resentful.I liked Sebastian, his siblings and Isabel. I appreciated how the tragic past was handled as part of the story, not a cudgel to wallow in and create more angst. They were the Ordinary Folks we all think we are until trials come our way and we learn not only is there more to us, but less as well. Confronting their own failings, they have compassion for other's. Mostly, it was absolutely wonderful to read an Awakening Story that wasn't all about the sexual attraction or trumped up conflicts that reduce hero and heroine to argumentative banter based on misunderstandings. They were cautious with each other, kind to themselves even. Taking time, giving support and space as needed, Sebastian and Isabel's story advanced even as the mysteries, debts and confusions mounted to a larger pile.I had a bit of difficulty with the last couple chapters of this book. It tied up \"too neatly\" for me. I like a bit of conflict left hanging, things to work through together in happily ever after land. In fairness, the financial situation is probably Huge Enough, not to mention the \"secret\" Sebastian has chosen to keep. I believe that will come back to bite them both in the end. Of course, it could simply be the fact I seldom like epilogues and this one was a bit too sweet for me. That said, I did enjoy 98.7% of the book, the writing style, characterizations, and well-handles story line. Definitely will look for other works by this author. I recommend Lord Somerton's Heir for when you're in a Traditional mood, looking for a meatier story with a gentle romance.~Note I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

K.A. Robinson outdid herself with the story of bad girl Alexandria struggling to come to terms with the consequences of her decisions and decide between Joel, the drug dealer with a good heart, and Landon, the golden farm boy that heals her tortured soul.When I read the synopsis, I knew that I had to read this book. It intrigued me. As I read the book, it drew me in and reminded me how heartbreaking and exhilarating young love can be. It was not a she loves him, she loves him not, gumball, giggly book. K.A. Robinson wrote a book about tests &#8211; of courage, strength, loss and love. It takes you on a journey with Alexandria as she figures out who she needs to be for herself before she decides whom she wants to love.Alexandria is unlike many teenage characters that you find. She has balls, guts, she admits her shortcomings and accepts her downfalls. Yes, she does it in typical teenage style with some defiance thrown, which needs to be there or she would have been an unbelievable character. I fell in love with her because she reminds me of teenage me (all those years ago).Joel and Landon are complete opposites and I think that is what makes it so hard for Alexandria to choose her path. Joel is her first love. I believe that he truly loves her but seems to put her in second place. Landon is every girl&#8217;s wet dream, but he seems too good to be true for Alexandria. I know if I were in her place, I would have some serious trouble deciding too.I will warn you &#8211; you will need tissues, alcohol and chocolate while you read. It is worth every tear that you shed when you get to the conclusion. The book is a stand alone &#8211; no cliffhanger.

However, I busted my tail on the farm and didn't have a chance at considering getting in trouble, lol.This story was so real, pulls you in and keeps you wondering what Alexandria will choose for herself and what she'll get handed next. You also see different sides to both Joel and Landon, which aren't exactly what you'd expect in the story. Gotta love the random plot twists, lol.

First, I will say that the portrayal of the verbally and emotionally abusive relationship was quite realistic. Lex's relationship with Brad was toxic and the author did an amazing job of writing about the effects it had on Lex's confidence and her relationships with close others.I also appreciated that Jaron came off as a real person. Despite his being in love with Lex, he cut her out of his life when she wouldn't leave Brad. There's only so long you can watch someone be hurt by others or hurt themselves before you crack and Jaron cracked, throwing away a life-long friendship. While it might not be considered the best reaction, it was completely understandable and probably something I would do.Beyond that, the book was quite boring. I often found my mind wandering while reading, which is never a good sign. There was nothing happening and a lot of thinking. There were some chapters that seemed like they were made up entirely of thoughts. Thoughts about the past; thoughts about whether or not they should do something; thoughts about whether or not Lex would ever be ready for a relationship with Jaron. I needed some action or interaction or drama or something!I also felt that the romance was lacking until the last 15% of the book or so. The first 85% was just Jaron helping Lex to let go of the past, which was fine, but there could have been some wooing in there as well.Unfortunately, this one just didn't work out for me.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Eh", "unixReviewTime": 1400889600, "reviewTime": "05 24, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "AXMYCOS4QGDSK", "asin": "B00JDLFHRI", "reviewerName": "Barbara Young", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "First of all love the Line .... could be that time of the month as I'm feeling Stabby as hell!! .........Another exciting foray in The Gyspy Brothers ... drama Smexy HOT-Ness ... although you don't want to get into those parts cause you know what happened to \"Sammi\" to get her to the point she's at now!!....But none the less these are exciting books...

Pembrey&#8217;s tale was fast-paced and interesting.We had a 54 year old cop being side-lined and pushed out by his superiors as they seek to concentrate resources on cases that attract decent publicity that plays well in the media for their political masters. Henk is conflicted whether to resist or give in and depart quietly. When he&#8217;s sidelined after showing an interest in the body in the harbour case, he decides to resist.His wife seems to be facing similar difficulties in her chosen profession of journalism. His daughter is at university and a degree of separation and misunderstanding is an element within the family dynamic. This was an interesting tangent to the main drive of the narrative, but it helped put a bit of flesh on the bones, without detracting from the pace of the investigation.The further Henk delved into the case, the closer his family came into danger.Amsterdam, canals, Red Light District, prostitutes, pimps, Hungarian gangs, people trafficking, local politicians, corruption, influence, police resources, media, murder, death, tattoos, mis-trust, family, retirement and more.I&#8217;m not going to pretend this was the best book I have ever read, but it did the job and ticked enough boxes to have me looking forward to his longer treatment.We had enough depth to our main cop character - Henk without getting bogged down with unnecessary fluff. The plot moved quickly and held my interest &#8211; I&#8217;ve not come across Hungarian gangsters before in either my fictional reading or in following European news in general &#8211; so I&#8217;m unsure if they are an author invention or a real problem, maybe slightly less bothersome than the Russian mafia. I&#8217;m minded enough to find out though.Our setting, Amsterdam was a first for me in a crime book setting and it was interestingly portrayed. I doubt that I&#8217;ll be rushing to pay a visit sometime soon. I think my previous perception of every building being either a brothel, sex shop or a church was only partially borne out as Pembrey didn&#8217;t introduce many churches into his narrative!All in all &#8211; quick and satisfying.4 from 5I was sent a file-copy of this by the author in return for an honest review,", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Interesting Amsterdam crime setting.", "unixReviewTime": 1400198400, "reviewTime": "05 16, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A35BKLDD2E04E6", "asin": "B00JDVWOT2", "reviewerName": "sonia", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "OMG found this book when someone posted it on Facebook.

Well, I have to say while I do love you dearly Sean, you are going to have to step down from the throne because Ringer has taken your place as my favorite Onslow boy thus far.  While I enjoyed getting to know Ringer in the other books in the series (which are companion novels), I totally fell in love with him in this book, and I can't wait for you to meet him.Miranda Henry is the love interest in the book and the female main character.  She is a biatch to the hilt, but I really did like her a lot.  She was just the kind of girl Ringer needed, and I think he is probably the only one who could handle her.  That said, Ringer is also just the kind of guy Miranda needed also, and probably only one who would capture her attention, as well as probably the only girl who could handle him.  Their relationship was a love-hate one filled with firey passion, and while they couldn't stand each other to start with, they also couldn't deny the chemistry and the desire for one another either.  I have to say that their inner rantings as well as the banter between them was hilarious and proved to provide for one entertaining read..The other Onslow boys make an appearance as well, which was awesome, and we got to meet a few new characters also.This is a 155 page novella, but it packs a punch and leaves you feeling totally satisfied and content with both the content and the ending, giving you more the feel of a novel.  There is also a wonderful epilogue, which I also adored.  I can't wait to read the next book in the series, which will be Adam and Ellie's story, and will be coming out in July.

Whether it's for bad or good, he's not exactly sure. He's tired of seeing his friends all lovey-dovey over their new girlfriends while he sits on the sidelines. Granted, he's always been the bad boy of the bunch, loving and leaving his own women whenever possible. Still, he's sick of being surrounded by so much love and sweetness.Making his way to his summer destination, Ringer never imagines the chaos that ensues. Having almost gotten run over on the way there, he's begun to wonder if the effort in getting away is worth it. Part of him doesn't think so, but he's agreed to do what he can for Max, and he'll stand by his word no what happens. Besides, things can't be that bad, can they?Meeting Miranda Henry soon changes his way of thinking. She's beautiful, brazen, and bad to the bone. In a sense, she's exactly like him, except she wants nothing to do with him. Ringer can't quite fathom as to why since he's never set eyes on her until now. The girl obviously knows what she wants, and it sure isn't him. A fact she makes known whenever possible.Refusing to give in to the way things are, Ringer sets out to teach Miranda a lesson she'll never forget. He's out in the middle of nowhere, determined to do the best job he can. There's nothing he's going to let a mere girl get in the way of. When things start heating up between them, and he sees a side of Miranda he never thought possible, he soon wonders what he's gotten himself. Will he be able to tame the lovely Miranda? Or will she end up being the one to teach him a lesson in return?Another lovely addition to The Boys Of Summers series, this is definitely a book you're going to want to read. The story picks up from Ringer's point-of-view, and tosses you head-first into his hectic summer. Things certainly et interesting when he and Miranda Henry collide.C. J. has created such delightful characters that anyone of an any age can relate to.

The first half of the book was mainly about Tommy and Amber and the bond they are forming.  I enjoyed them as they were taking the next step and starting a life together.For me personally, the second half of the book was all over the place.  You have Sally&#8217;s the crazy roommate and cousin who is whoring all over campus causing heartbreaks everywhere she goes.  Then Karen and her boyfriend problems, and now someone is attacking women on campus.Amber and Tommy have a very hot sexual relationship. They both enjoy BDSM and Tommy is helping Amber discover what she likes, however that plays a very small roll in the book compared to Sally and even Karen at the end.  So once again, my biggest complaint, and for this one it&#8217;s really the only complaint is that the secondary character took too much away from the main characters.

She comes face to face with Chad, a vampire who was sent to fight with them. Genevieve screams in fear and strengthens her determination to escape. Her next attempt leads her back to the garage and into the back of one of the SUVs.  When part of the group leaves in search of the CAT, the hybrid vampires, Genevieve is hidden away.  She makes it out of the compound but realizes she is leaving Boston too.  She has to wait and bide her time until they stop and she can sneak away.However, she is found and paired with Chad.  She is then forced to accompany the group in their search.  Chad is not thrilled about being stuck with the human.  In fact he lets his anger get the best of him as he walks away from the group.  Genevieve lets her fear get the best of her and it causes the mission to get extremely dangerous very quickly.

A king with 12 daughters and one son. At his fifth birthday he is gifted a sword with jewels and a sharp edge and because of a small misstep by the servant presenting it to him, the little boy becomes a barbaric image of his father in one small act. It is the last act that gives Leena the push to leave with her lover. She wanted to save her half brother, keep him from being like their father, but seeing no chance of it now, she and her lover plan their escape. As you can imagine, things aren't that simple.It's a good story, Leena reminding me of a strong heroine from other stories. For some reason it feels like this setting is in the Far East, but there really isn't a reason I can say why. Just my idea. I thought at first with the twelve sisters this would be part of a retelling of the Twelve Dancing Princesses. No, not at all. There is the hint of political scheming going on, a barbaric and misogynistic ruler, and adventure. I've read the synopsis for the next full novel and I can't see how they are connected at all, but I am going to read it. The story is not unique, but it is compelling enough that I want to know what happens to Leena and what that next story has to do with her story.If you enjoy fantasy, I think you'll enjoy this one.

She writes perfect male characters. The right balance of charming, sexy, masculine, and caring. I find many authors try to write a perfect fantasy man and fall flat because they come off as being unbelievable. Instead of making me swoon, the crap that comes out of their mouths sounds like a woman trying to write a perfect male character. Aven, on the other hand, writes my perfect man. Nothing Harry said made me eye-roll. In fact, I was so busy swooning over him that I can&#8217;t remember much except for the wild beat of my pitter-pattering heart.2.) She paints scenes so you feel like you are watching them play out. The clothing, the food, the way she describes movements. This book came alive for me and it felt more like watching a great romantic comedy than reading a book. In fact, this book should be a movie because that would be most enjoyable.3.) She makes me laugh. This book was down right funny! I was cracking up over different scenes and little one-liners. It was super entertaining and an absolute pleasure to read.

So I will leave you to ponder on that for a while...Shel: These two are adorable. Court's correct in that they both have a few sensitive spots that cause outbursts and anxious times but I'm grateful that these were moments that were few and far between.Court: I loved the moments of Kylie and Harrison. Every single one. From the unassuming way they met, to how they reconnect (totally realistic and fun...loved that) to how they progress through getting to know each other and adjusting to Harrison's fame as a hottie hockey player. And then...as I mentioned...Harrison has some bouts of insecurities of his own and does not handle them very well...which I was kind of grateful for because it made him seem more rough around the edges and normal than his sweetheart attitude made him to be at first...and we love the bad boys. Shel: I love that Kylie is a smidge neurotic (but she totally owns it) and that he finds her quirks adorable. And, I love that she has absolutely no desire to be connected to Harrison's fame at all. Their love story is quick but the way they connect doesn't seem too fast or too impulsive or too off at all. I found it incredibly sweet and a nice break from the angst-fest we sometimes read (with the exception of some jerks--because there are definitely some jerks that make an appearance).Court: I love when I have actually visited the setting being portrayed and recognize places (Hello, ice skating at the Galleria in Dallas...my experience was about as great as Kylie's...ice princess, I am not) and that was a lot of fun! I loved the book, the writing, the pace, the characters...there really wasn't anything not to love unless you count Kylie's co-workers (bitches).

Author Aven Ellis blew my mind with Waiting For Prince Harry. This novel just plain and simply wonderful. What I thought ( while judging the cover and the blurb ) would be a cute read, turned out to be totally addictive! I had such a hard time putting this book down. I took every spare minute I got ( Okay....I was actually hiding from my kids, don't judge me! This book was worth it, though. * shy smile*) to continue reading about Kylie and Harrison.Dear Lord, where to start with explaining their story?Well, let me tell you first that I had the pleasure of reading the authors previous work ( Connectivity) and I fell in love with her ability to create wonderful characters. In Waiting For Prince Harry, the author left me no other choice than to fall deeply in love with not only the hero but also the heroine of the book.The things they went through as a couple were ( in my opinion ) harder than hell and I am so happy they fought through it all. Being a professional athlete is a dream job, but what comes along with that profession can be exhausting for a couple, especially if 2 people are at the beginning of their relationship. So, you can imagine how hard life was for them, right? Who can deal with having THE most hottest ginger/ green eyed hockey player in the history of the book world as a boyfriend? Not me. Even though it would have killed me to stay away ( people, he's one hot, hotter than hot, bbf!) from Harrison, I couldn't have done what Kylie and Harrison went through. Nope.I also loved how the characters struggled to keep things real without trying to change themselves ( that sounds confusing.....read the book yourself....you'll know what I mean ) The love they share for one another is so grand that it will make you want to find yourselves a Harrison too!My head was spinning from the romance and the fun while reading this book.

He was broad. He had the perfect amount of stubble on his jawline, and those eyes were to-die for &#8211; deep brown and piercing.  Then there was his hair &#8211; thick, brown, and ideal for sliding fingers through.  She didn&#8217;t want to take her eyes off him, but she knew better than to stare.&#8221;Meet Julia Bell:&#8220;&#8230;hot as sin with those curves, those breasts, and the perfect kind of hips that he&#8217;d like to get his hands on.  Her hair was lush and reddish brown. Her lips were full and ripe for kissing. As well as other things. But, more than that, she was feisty, with that smart mouth firing off innuendo with every word. She could dish it out, and she could take it.&#8221;Clay and Julia are sexually dominant, confident and hot. They each know what they want and they go into this First Night with no expectations other than hot, steamy sex for some needed release.  I love the interaction between the two of them, feisty and full of sexual innuendos. They seem to &#8220;get&#8221; each other from the beginning.  They get into it right away; there is no romancing and no prolonged back and forth. They just go for it.  The sex is hot and they each want to dominate and control, but they also know when to submit and let the other take control. I love Clay&#8217;s commands and dirty talk. Julia knows how to give it and she knows how to take it.  This novella is all about their night of sex.One of my favorite lines: &#8220;Do you want a Purple Snow Globe, Clay?&#8221; He met her gaze straight on, her green eyes so inviting. &#8220;If it&#8217;s a drink, no. If purple snow globe is a secret code word for something naughty, I&#8217;m game.&#8221;This novella is the prequel to Night After Night, which is a full-length novel that will release on April 18th.

J.E. Plemons introduces us to Arena Power, a fifteen year-old orphan who braves a harsh, new world in this first installment of what promises to be an addictive new series. Best of all, this is a full-length novel rather than the 40-page snippet that some authors try to pass of as a &#34;book&#34; in a series. Not only was I entertained with a rich and imaginative story that showcased top-notch writing, I did not feel cheated when I finished.The end of the world is at hand through the wrath of an angry God. Arena and her twin brother are involuntarily cast into the role of preparing humanity for its demise. The story delves into a character study that reveals an interesting and tragic family history that is skillfully woven together to give us a greater understanding and empathy for the characters as the story builds to a resounding crescendo.An undeniable Christian message is intertwined into the fabric of the story without seeming &#34;preachy&#34;. This is, first and foremost, an adrenaline-laced thriller, but the theological elements add a compelling twist that makes it even more exciting, in my opinion. The introduction of religious elements merely sets the stage for the conflict between good and evil, which can be considered a universal part of the human condition.While the physical devastation of the United States has not, yet, reached the catastrophic proportions of King&#8217;s &#34;The Stand&#34; or Cormac McCarthy&#8217;s &#34;The Road&#34;, an atmosphere of impending doom still looms like an ominous cloud. The U.S. is no longer the world superpower that it once was, and it now turns to its former rivals for assistance while poverty reigns in the streets. Like all good apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic literature, the end of the world is attached to an existential catastrophe&#8230;in this case, divine judgment.J.E. Plemons conveys a sense of danger through prose that is both haunting and surreal, and he conveys a sense of urgency through the serious and sometimes desperate dialogue of his characters. While this could be considered YA literature, it is certainly of a quality that promises to hold appeal for all ages, and I look forward to the second novel.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Smart, inventive, and haunting!", "unixReviewTime": 1405036800, "reviewTime": "07 11, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "AIH3QOVEL4YF3", "asin": "B00JFYXGVC", "reviewerName": "shauna1118", "helpful": [10, 10], "reviewText": "Devin and Rebecca's story continue's as he tries to solve the mystery who killed Brent.

Not for 99% of writers and publishers, anyway. Certainly not for anyone who's planning a long-term career in publishing.Most beginners need to do more than one thing right. In fact, they need to do practically everything right... in the nuts-and-bolts aspects of publishing, anyway.  Worse, most beginners are starting with a publishing budget of exactly zero dollars.This book explains exactly what a beginner can do, every step of the way, to produce a book with a good chance of selling... and perhaps selling very well. Even better, Ms. Heuser talks you through the zero-budget version of publishing. It can be a tricky process the first time through, and Ms. Heuser's screenshots will answer most or all beginners' questions.I like this book because it's simple and direct. It doesn't list half a dozen options that could give a beginner a good reason to pause and &#34;think about it.&#34;  (Publishing your first book can seem scary and overwhelming. You need a guide like this.)This book takes the reader from start to finish, publishing and selling a book.While my own publishing techniques are different in some cases -- especially the formatting tool Ms. Heuser recommends -- I can wholeheartedly praise this book because her directions work.  That's all you really need for your first few books.Beginning publishers can take this book and follow the directions, step by step, gaining confidence after two or three books. At that point, you'll move past the &#34;beginner&#34; phase and can start trying other options... with the necessary insights you'll acquire by following a plan like Ms. Heuser's.No two publishers are likely to follow the exact same steps, use the exact same tools, and have the exact same priorities.However, if you just need to get started (in mid-2014), and want to be sure you're following a plan that actually works, you will not find a better book than this.Skip others' hype that boasts &#34;one easy step&#34; or &#34;a sneaky loophole&#34; to overnight success in publishing.

Vernon was released back in 2012, and now, after what seemed like a long wait, he returns with his first fantasy novel titled Bound to the Abyss, Part One.In this new story, we are introduced to Ean Sangrave, who can&#8217;t seem to get himself out of trouble. Whether he&#8217;s being beat by the village&#8217;s gang of bullies, or he&#8217;s getting on the bad side of the adults, Ean is always looked down. He is the apprentice of the village&#8217;s Healer Cleff, one of the few people that treats him, a little, better, due to the tragic past involving his deceased parents. But, what villagers don&#8217;t know is that more than a simple healer&#8217;s apprentice, he has a great connection to the Abyss, a place feared for its darkness and dangerous creatures.From this dreaded place is where he actually found the only living creature that has become close enough to be called friend. The imp, Zin, a character that was first introduced in The Three Moons Realm. Zin has returned from the Abyss, ready to help Ean gain new powers. When everything looks brighter for both of them for the first time, the village&#8217;s mine is inhabited by a deadly creature devouring all that comes to its reach.Curious to see the creature, Ean heads to the mine, only to barely escape its teeth with the help of his new abilities. When, Jaslen, a farm girl whom Ean is fond of, and Bran, the mayor&#8217;s oldest son and Jaslen&#8217;s boyfriend, follow him to see the Heroes sent to kill the creature fail, Ean&#8217;s life becomes more involved with the village&#8217;s safety than ever before, changing his future from that moment on. He is chosen to travel along with Bran to try and find a solution to the village&#8217;s problems. As the adventure continues, Ean gradually transforms from the nobody, people saw him as to a skilled healer, friend, and Abyss energy user.I was really happy to know that The Three Moons Realm stories had continued. I really liked vol. 1 and was eager to find out more about the characters and what their futures held for them. Bound to the Abyss is my kind of book genre, so reading about magic spells, creatures, and a boy finding its way in life, was definitely a must-read for me. But, I must say that Zin remains my favorite character of the whole story. He&#8217;s witty, wicked, and knows more than what he lets others know, which makes him more intriguing. The story had a good pace and was easy to follow. There aren&#8217;t many characters to get lost in, or constantly change points of view, which is more comfortable. Although we meet people here and there throughout the journey, the plot is mainly centered on Ean and his companions.I do have to add that there was a character that I started to dislike halfway through the story, Jaslen. She turned a little irritating and at one point I hoped she wouldn&#8217;t end up sentimentally involved with Ean. He needs someone brave enough to stand the sound of an Abyss hound feasting on a Troll. This is where Paige appeared and his life became a little more interesting in that matter, but she was left behind. I hope she makes an appearance on future books.The story is mostly a road trip, in which Ean at first feels dragged into, but then learns that there is a lot of information kept from him and possibly the villagers back home. This sparked an interest in me on anticipating another book. There are questions unanswered that I would like to know find out just like Ean, but I&#8217;ll have to wait.The Three Moons Realm has interesting stories waiting to be developed, and Bound to the Abyss is just as good which I recommend you read.

I was so happy when I found out out that some of my favorite hockey romance authors had teamed up to release an anthology, Seduced by the Game, a collection of hockey novellas with all proceeds going to Hockey Fights Cancer.Toni Aleo- TANGLED IN LACES:In Tangled in Laces, Karson King is on the fast track to the pros and Lacey Martin is coming back from a hard fight against cancer and is terrified of him, but their love is too much to ignore. Will Karson prove that he will protect her heart at all costs, or will he live Lacey to pick up the pieces of her life once again?Review: This prequel has me setting up a count down ticker to 2015, it is hot, full of love, drama and just the right amount of angst to catch me.. hook, line and sinker!

For Scott's part, he has to know the woman who stirred his blood with just a look, and once he does, he realizes he wants Hannah to be his forever.

I loved the story, it came together beautifully, and holy crap was it HOT! I can't wait for more from these authors and love the HEA they gave me in the small amount of space they had available!Jami Davenport- CRASHING THE BOARDS (Seattle Sockeyes 1.5)Professional party crasher, Izzy Maxwell, needs the cooperation of reluctant party guess Cooper Black, the team captain of Seattle's new hockey team, but Cooper can't get past his anger over the teams relocation to Seattle. Can Izzy melt Cooper's frozen heart or will this party crash along with her fledgling business?Review: Jami Davenport NEVER disappoints! Crashing the Boards is a whirlwind romance, full of steam. I loved Cooper and Izzy and the HEA I felt like I got at the end of the novella&#8230; THEN Jami surprised me by announcing that this is just a teaser that Cooper and Izzy are getting a full length book, I can't wait- it is sure to be just as fabulous as this prequel!Catherine Gayle- Taking a Shot (Portland Storm 2.5)Katie Weber has had a crush on Jamie Babcock for almost two years, since he joined her fathers hockey team, the Portland Storm as an eighteen-year old rookie. When cancer takes her health, her hair, and even her friends, she can't bear to go to senior prom&#8230; until Jamie intervenes.Review: First off, let me start by saying if you are a fan of hockey romance and aren't reading Catherine Gayle's Portland Storm series, STOP reading right now and pick up the first two books in this series. This author has a way of writing hockey romance that fans of the game and the genre will love. Now, back to this story. I have loved Katie and Jamie's budding attraction in the first two books of this series and had even emailed this author asking WHEN they are getting their story. They are slowly growing up before our very eyes and this book is perfect. Jamie has a crush on Katie from afar (mainly because her father, and his teammate, will have him sleeping with the fishes if he gets too close to his daughter). Katie is battling cancer and when Jamie risks life and limb (reference the previous sentence) and asks to take her to her senior prom it gives her the motivation she needs to keep fighting. This is a sweet story that left me with tears in my eyes and super excited to know that eventually they will get their own book and it is going to be WONDERFUL!Jaymee Jacobs- A Valuable TradeBryan's life gets turned upside down when he gets traded to the Dallas Comets, and things get even messier when he meets Georgiana the Director of Team Services. He's got a lot of work to do to prove his worth to his new team, but Georgian's sure he'll prove to be a valuable trade.Review: I love a story where a girl who is &#34;one of the guys&#34; finds love. This is no exception, this was my first Jaymee Jacobs read and I look forward to reading more about the Dallas Comets.V.L. Locey- Heir ApparentSuperstar Cam Evans is fighting to climb out of a slump that's growing worse with each day of living in denial. Fresh from the minors, Jacobi Neal is hungry for this chance to play back-up for the legendary goalie. Can two men battle each other, their inner demons, and the sizzling attraction building between them.Review: I am not normally drawn to m/m stories, but this novella gave me a taste of what I have been missing and I was hooked. These two men are not only fighting for their careers, but are also fighting for love, this is a hot, tension filled ride that left me wanting more from this author!Bianca Sommerland- Blind Pass (The Dartmouth Cobras 0.5)Nothing could stop Tim Rowe, the assistant coach of the Dartmouth Cobras, from falling in love with Madeline, but love alone can't satisfy every need. Sometimes, to reach the goal, you have to take a chance with a&#8230; Blind Pass.Review:  How is their a hockey romance series out that I haven't read? I am so excited this anthology put Bianca Sommerland on my radar and after reading this prequel to her Dartmouth Cobra series,  I MUST find all the books out so far and read them.. Geesh, and I call myself a fan of hockey romance. I am buckled in if this prequel is any indication of this series I am about to go for one fun, hot ride!Nikki Worrell- Captain, My Captain (Prequel to Scorpions Series)Keith Lambert is captain of the Flyers- until he's not. To everyone's shock, he's traded to the San Diego Scorpions. As if that's not bad enough, Phoebe his girlfriend of two years, decides she doesn't love him enough to follow.All alone in a new town, Keith is drawn to Kelly, his take out delivery girl. When she shows up at ice girl tryouts he's lost. She's all he can see. Can he convince her to forget her past and take a chance on him or is he destined to be alone in a new town a little bit longer?Review: Nikki Worrell is one of my favorite hockey romance authors and I loved this prequel to a series I am already in love with! If you are a fan of hockey romance you need to be reading Nikki Worrell and this teaser gives a good peek into her writing style, get out your debit card, you will want to purchase the Scorpion books to date (if you haven't already) after reading Captain, My Captain!If you can't tell from my reviews above, not only is purchasing this book supporting a great cause, but you are also getting a HUGE return on your investment.

It's a table setter and not really something that feels self-contained though it leaves things on an ominous happy for now note.Its a quick one and quite simply tells the story of a goddess, Allia, and the Demon Lord she set out to entrap to stop the demons' further destruction of the human world.  Allia and the Demon Lord know from their first touch that they are meant to be.  Both tentatively reach out and relish their secret times together.

Rachel was a whitty and fun character all on her own, strong and stubborn but needing some romance and TLC.  The two together were a fun couple to get to know and I loved how thier relationship grew throughout the book.The writing style in this book was really good and it was a really enjoyable read, it holds your attention and makes you want to see what happens next.

The two main characters, Jenna and Sutton were annoying and went back and forth in their relationship with each other. It got frustrating and midway through I just wanted them to walk away. The whole plotline of the book revolved around Jenna's fianc&eacute; (Adam) cheating on her with her bestfriend and Sutton's sister, Lacey. Adam and Lacey were both deplorable characters and at the end we were supposed to empathize with Lacey and forgive her and I just couldn't do it. No matter the reasons why they got together, I couldn't forgive it and feel anything besides disgust with her, and I couldn't see how anyone else could either. The plan that Jenna and Sutton came up with to break Adam and Lacey up never really came to be anything, which was disappointing because it was one of the things that drew me to the book in the first place, I was hoping for so much more from it. Also, Jenna and Sutton had known each other for years, so by the time the reader became involved in their lives it felt like I was missing something, I never really got the connection between the two and that was frustrating.

I suspect there's more to Cassie's actions too than we see on the surface. Emily, she's running from her problems, and yet they always follow - its something that she knows won't work. She married her ex in an effort to get normal, wanted what she never had growing up and though Geoff was dull he seemed to provide the normality and support she wanted.  Having had a chequered family life as she grew up, then after catching the jerk out, she escaped and stayed with her sisters best friend Ben - and had a one night stand.....then she ran from that too. She makes a new friend in Annie, they come home and share a flat. Emily tries to tell Ben something important several times, but something always stops her.Ben's been trying to get past her, past his feelings for her and make a new start, but found it difficult when she was away, now she's back its even harder, though the attractive owner of the new shop next to his is proving a good distraction.Emily keeps on putting off telling him, despite Annie and Charlotte, her sister, Ben's friend, telling her she must do it. As ever secrets have a way of getting out and this one does that right at the wrong moment. There are more than just this secret that comes out too...The story is fun, it has angst and jealousy ( I love that) lots of drama, and the others involved play large parts too making for an easy to read, light hearted, enjoyable romance.

Brown", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "This is a collection of public domain novellas and short stories by three of the most important pre-pulp science fiction writers: Jules Verne, H. G. Wells and Arthur Conan Doyle. These are adventure stories first, with important scientific speculations embedded, rather than space opera romances or hard science fiction. They are the works that inspired many of the leaders of the post-WWII scientific revolution as well as the serious pulp science fiction writers from the 1930s to the 1950s.Among e-book compilations of public domain literature, I grade this a B. The typography is consistent and attractive, and works at a variety of font sizes. Headings are clear and I found no obvious spelling errors, omissions or other errors. There is no extraneous or repeated material. There is a table of contents with links, both within the book itself and supplied in metadata for your reader (however the in-text is organized differently, which is a bit confusing). On the negative side, the contents do not distinguish between chapters and books, so it can be a even more confusing.The book does not include internal links, nor definitions of unusual words or characters. There are only single-paragraph biographies of the three authors and no forwards or notes. Publication details including year, edition, translator (for Verne) and so on are sparse or missing entirely. On the topic of translators, the Verne translations are quite bad, but not the worst. However much of the scientific detail is garbled or omitted, and the prose is clumsy and wooden. Sadly few of Verne's works are available in really good English translations so readers with no French do not a lot of better options.The material works best as stories--energetic, imaginative, compelling and brilliantly told. These are the still-fresh originals of characters and plots that have been imitated into stock jokes. Even the lesser efforts have considerable literary merit and are fun to read. There are stilted Victorian and Edwardian conventions in these stories, the clothes, role of servants, attitudes toward non-Europeans and women can charm or repel at various times, both when prejudices of the time are breached or honored. There is some offensive material: antisemitism, racism, imperialism, protofascism and other unpopuar isms. However all of the authors have much more on the other side of the balance, positive ideas that transcended both their era and commonplace acceptance of injustice. If you're looking to be offended you will have no trouble finding objectionable parts but in my opinion, taken as a whole, these are some of the good guys.None of this is great literature, the stories and speculations take priority over stylish prose or emotional depth. Dramatic events, bold characters and fascinating ideas keep our interest, not realism, philosophic subtlty or character development. Most of the science is hopelessly outdated, of course, but the curiousity, rationalism and courageous willingness to challenge common sense speak clearly to true seekers of truth of any generation.If you love good stories and scientific curiousity, you should read these works. You can find them free on the Internet, but these have been formatted for convenience on an e-reader. You can pay a little more for better physical editions, and in some cases for better electronic editions.

If I could give this 3.5 stars, I would.This book continues the story of Kyle Tait, who walked/biked from Texas to his home in Montana.  Mr. Gorham's writing is smooth, and the editing is good, and in my view, the predecessor book &#34;77 days in September&#34; is among the best of the various &#34;get home when the SHTF&#34; books available out there.  Here, Mr. Gorham goes into additional detail about how a small town community in Montana (I picture Deer Creek as being one of the towns in the Bitteroot valley) tries to survive the coming winter.  The author does a good job of discussing how the community handles conflicts, how the new economy develops, etc.SPOILERSSome additional observations:- The book focuses quite a bit on the main character's marriage and family.  Many reviewers found this sappy and perhaps overdone.  I did not; I thought it added a dimension to the story that is often lacking from these kinds of books.- There are some inaccuracies and things I would change regarding the description of guns in the book.  For example, many people in the community of people who read these sorts of books don't like the phrase &#34;assault rifle&#34;.  In any event, while there is good action in the book, it is not an army field manual, which is fine.- Unlike some reviewers, I liked the trial sequence and thought it added some drama (although no suprises) to the story.  However, I think the author really missed an opportunity to talk about how a justice system would evolve/be implemented in a post-SHTF isolated community.  For example, at some point the community needs to have a discussion about what criminal procedures it wants, so that everyone can be confident that they get a fair shake if they are falsely accused.  There has to be buy-in for the procedures.  It would have been nice to go into that kind of discussion a little more.  Also, if I, like Tait, had been railroaded to conviction in a kangaroo court like that, I would have a hard time forgiving and forgetting.  This is sort of thing that historically has sparked generations-long bloody feuds.  That might have been explored.- Finally, the author does a good job of pointing out that everyone is skinny and hungry, but I think he really could have rubbed the reader's face in it a little more.  People talk about how bad places like Phoenix or Las Vegas might be without power or motor vehicles.  I don't think that the northern rockies would be much better.  With such a short growing season, and brutal winters, places like Montana are also pretty marginal for big human populations without modern technology.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "A worthy sequel to a very good book", "unixReviewTime": 1401062400, "reviewTime": "05 26, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A3HPXR9M6KQSXJ", "asin": "B00JJYH24A", "reviewerName": "kathleen", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "Enjoyed the book.

Endress", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "Full disclosure: I received an ebook copy of this work in exchange for an unbiased, honest review.Like its two predecessors, &#34;Cursed Children&#34; is set in the land of Naor, telling three stories connected only by their focus on the great forces of good and evil playing out their battle through the singular and unlikely. Like its predecessors, it is intensely descriptive and includes a many-faceted, highly variable cast that will surprise and impress you as they draw you onward. Also like its predecessors, it seems to have lost some of its sheen in translation, as errors abound, though hey do not detract some of the comprehensibility of the story.Again, the stories come from frozen lands, a medieval countryside, and the mysterious desert. The protagonists are each strong in their own ways, but have a lot of growing to do, especially in the third story. We spend a comparatively short time with these characters, but I found myself growing very attached. All in all, three solidly-told stories.Bottom line: If you liked the first two, you'll like this one as well; if you didn't, you won't. If you've never read any of them before, but are a fan of high fantasy with the severity of realism, this might be for you.

It is in England working with Cait's mom and grandmother that Fer feels she belongs somewhere. the side characters of Johnny and Ran are great as well. the Archeon that helps has a wee bit of a snarky attitude but I guess if you are a book worm you can. I love what happens when he is introduced to the smartphone and information highway.It takes Caits life being in danger for her mom to wake up from her despair of losing her husband and embrace who she is. A witch  descended from Ilminion. Not a good dude. Glad he's dead phew. Anywho Cait, her mom, her grandmother, danny, ran and fer are set out to stop the Lich King from gaining more power while being chased by Genera. A wonderful ending that has a wee bit of a cliffy..a great fantastical book about witches and finding your strengths and growing into yourself and your confidence in yourself. I love the romance that  began with Danny and Cait and hope his heroics in the end are not in vain. I would like to see them together at the end of this trilogy.

Within the first few pages, we jump from an antechamber of a mysterious planet run by a genetically engineered creature, to WWII Russia. From the maps provided before the prologue, it becomes apparent that the story can only get stranger from here.As other reviewers have mentioned, this is definitely an interesting mix of genres, hopping from science fiction to WWII adventure to pre-Civil War drama and more. While I enjoyed the interplay of the different genres, I felt that this was also a hindrance at times. I found that the WWII sections with Yakob had the strongest and most refined writing, while the Plantation sections felt the weakest and most raw. On their own, each of these storylines could be expanded to a short story or novella that ties into the same plot, but by being put together, there isn&#8217;t as much space to focus on the separate threads as individual stories, resulting in an unpolished feel in some parts. The dialogue is also a bit heavy-handed at times, bordering the line between realistic dialogue and caricature dialogue.Even with these drawbacks (and don&#8217;t get the wrong idea, they are quite minor nitpicks of mine), I still enjoyed the overall plot greatly, if not for the interesting concept, then at least for the gutsy decision to try to pull it off (and be mostly successful). The story definitely starts off a bit slow, and because of the hopping around, the pacing also feels a bit off at times, but it definitely picks up in the last two-thirds of the book. I could see some people not liking the book because of what feels like a lack of focus due to the genre-hopping, but I could also see some people really enjoying it the blend of genres. Of all the genre fans, it would most likely appeal to science fiction fans the most, as the other two genres feel more like a result of the plot instead of being plot drivers. While it&#8217;s not for everyone, I&#8217;d still be likely to recommend it to fans of science fiction.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "An interesting mix of genres", "unixReviewTime": 1402876800, "reviewTime": "06 16, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "AMIJW1V6IVE43", "asin": "B00JLRZVL6", "reviewerName": "brenda", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "Hope starts off at a comforting pace.

Promise is forced/coerced into marrying an older leader of her religion.  Needless to say after the 'wedding night' things did not go so well for Promise.  When she runs into Grayson and begs for his help, the relationship between Promise, who is trying to heal, and Grayson, who wants to protect her, is born.From the beginning, this book was intense and contained some uncomfortable brutal scenes, well written, but brutal.  Grayson was a gentle soul.  If it was not for the motorcycle, you would have no idea that he belonged to a MC.  I was emotionally drawn to Promise in the beginning.  She went through a lot and stayed strong.  The action drama...AMAZING!!  I was sitting on the edge of my seat screaming at my reader!  Several characters from book one, &#34;Know Me&#34; were weaved into this story:  Kira/Orion, Rachel/Casper, Maddox, Brandon, Teague.  I hope more books will be coming in this series about some of the secondary characters!Why Not 5 Stars?Rawness of the MC -  This did not feel like a Motorcycle club.  I had no idea what the club did for money or what they were into.  In fact, if you took away the bikes, this was just a story.  I like my MC books raw and edgy.  Other than the biker's use of profanity, they have a squeaky clean club.  Grayson, while he was sweet and tender, I did not see any of his hardness throughout the book.  *Sigh*Change in Character Personalities -  I was endeared to Promise in the beginning.  However, she totally changed and none of her previous qualities remained after she got busy with Grayson.  She all of a sudden turned into some hard chick.  It was just not believable.  Don't get me wrong...I loved her for the fight scene...she rocked it!  Kira, what happened to her?  She came off as a 17 year old high school girl who bounces into rooms.  This was not her personality in &#34;Know Me&#34;.  I did not understand the need to change it.  I hate to pick on Grayson again, but after the scene where he initially meets Kira, that was the last time we saw our tough, kick-butt hero.  His character turned into a wuss.

I just loved Nana Mae, agree letting the crazy out is a good thing. \"My wise old Cajun Maw Maw used to say, \"Hide your crazy, girl. Ain't nobody wanna see that s***.\"Maw Maw died of a heart attack at the age of sixty-two. My other grandmother, Nana Mae, who is neither Cajun nor known for being exceptionally wise, is still kicking at eighty-five and says it's because she lets all her crazy out.\" Nana Mae said \"It was better in my day\" When we'd leave the house, we left the grid. No cell phones to track you down.\" \"Same here\" I said \"Although I had neighbors that were more efficient than any electronic device. Still do. Mrs. Mercer next door nearly called the cops the first time Patrick came over on his bike.\"I just loved that I thought it was so funny. I loved the scene on the rules of not skipping school with Jules and her daughter I had to chuckle. I can't tell you how many times I myself have said \"This is why wild animals sometimes eat their young.\"Totally loved the part where Mark meets Becca mother for the first time. Mark just comes downstairs from Becca room and Jules goes into her nice to meet you and you have no respect to meet me the right way. Then she said \"Mark, I would've liked to have met you a different way, but since I didn't, let me fill you in. Becca isn't allowed to skip class. Don't know if you are, but she's not. You aren't allowed in her room. Ever. You will respect those things, and keep all your personal property in your pants, and we will get along just fine.\" What an outstanding lady, I laughed so hard.Jules mother I understood why she did what she did, I didn't like it but she did what she thought was best for her daughter. It seems she has secrets of her own, now that I have a hard time forgiving or understanding. I can't say I didn't like her character, yes she made me mad but she was understandable and I feel a lot of mother in that day and age would have done the same things.Noah father what is there not to love about man who was deeply hurt as well. He doesn't let a day go by that he isn't showing how he feels or letting Jules forget. 26 years of bottled up pain is a lot of pain to push around, he has no problem making Jules as unhappy as he can. Everyone has secrets even Noah father, will his bring the family together or tear them more apart?I wanted so much not to like Noah girlfriend Shayna and the mother of his soon to be child. I wanted so much for Noah and Jules to get back together, to make a wrong a right. What is there not to love about this sweet caring women, everyone likes her even Jules. Even Jules ex Hayden is like able even with all his issues. This is all I can tell you without giving the book away, I hope it has interested you enough to go buy the wonderful outstanding book.There are so many places in this story that will make you smile, laugh and bring you to tears, each better then the last. Most will stick with you for day if not years. This book by Ms, Lovelace is a keeper, 5+ star that will keep you hanging on to each word as you spin your way through all her twist and turns.

When his younger brother Nick visits him in the hospital, Jed agrees to return to their small hometown of Ashton outside Portland.Since Jed wants to get to know Nick's wife Kim and their two daughters, and because Jed has nowhere else to go, he at first accepts an invitation to stay with Nick's family. When Nick's townhouse begins to feel too crowded and Nick's drinking worsens, Jed agrees to move into the spare bedroom at the beachside home where Kim's adult brother Max lives.Twenty-five year old Max, an epileptic, and his service dog Flo have carved out an idyllic life in their cabin by the lake. Max creates hand-hewn furniture to sell and lives an uncomplicated life, raising his own food. When he has seizures, Flo is trained to get help, so Max is fairly self-sufficient.Jed and Max seem to rub on very well together, forging a friendship and then falling in love. In fact, for a while Max is even able to concoct meals that Jed's chronic stomach illness can tolerate.However, instead of healing, Jed seems to be losing ground as PTSD and his physical wounds get worse. When Max has a particularly bad seizure and Jed discovers that Max and Kim aren't who they said they were, all of their lives spiral downhill quickly.Jed is a particularly interesting man. Having been kicked out of the house by an alcoholic father when he came out, Jed joined the army, turning his back on his brother Nick who proceeded to suffer the brunt of the old man's abuse. When Nick turns up at his bedside, Jed realizes how much he let his brother down, just as Jed blames himself for leading his eight-man army crew into a lethal attack.In order to find personal peace and build a new life, Jed must work through forgiving himself for past mistakes as well as make amends for leaving his brother. His physical condition, however, makes it difficult for him to see beyond his own aching, scarred body.Max too is an intriguing, loving and giving man. While he and his sister Kim had a frightful childhood, they have a chance at happiness, a chance that they are diligent about expanding. Most people, including Jed, are blinded by Max's illness and don't see his inner strength and stability. When push comes to shove, Max isn't a wimp but a survivor.ONLY LOVE is one of those romances in which readers will be pulling for Jed and Max as a couple to grow and bloom. Both fight for their right to happiness and even though their story is rocky, readers will be at their side every step of the way.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent read!", "unixReviewTime": 1398988800, "reviewTime": "05 2, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "AX0HKCUF4YQNN", "asin": "B00JMORESG", "reviewerName": "Brenda Harrison", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "I need a 4th book to complete everything and everything body.

His roommate, who is also his sister's boyfriend, has kidnapped Kylie.When Cameron gets to the scene of the wreck, he isn't sure Kylie is alive. Hefinds that she has survived but is in a bad condition and must go to thehospital. She is unconscious for several days.When she wakes up Cameron is there with her. Cameron leaves the rest of theracing season to take care of her until she is better. Kylie feels that sheneeds to stay independent and doesn't want to interfere with his dream job as aNASCAR driver. These two must figure out where to compromise and where torespect the others wishes. Right now the only place Kylie wants Cameron to takecontrol of her is in the bedroom... or where ever they decide to get it on.Comprises are made, new relationships are formed, but the past will come backto haunt them in the end.I give this book 3.5 out of 5 starsI still think the characters in this book are great. Kylie is a veryindependent woman and has bounced back well from all she has gone through.Cameron is still an awesome and caring boyfriend. This book also gives morestory of Kylie's best friend Courtney Conner.I like the fact that, in some parts, as soon as I thought I knew what wasgoing to happen it turned out totally different than I expected. I can't saywhat it was without revealing some major spoilers.Even though there were some things I didn't expect at all, there were somethings that just seem to be in every book right now. Our main character ends upin the hospital unconscious for days. There's a jealous boyfriend in a bar thatbeats up another guy for being around his girlfriend. There's a few more, butagain I don't want to give any spoilers.In the first book I was okay with all the sex going on between Kylie andCameron. They were a couple getting reacquainted after years apart. Now, it justseemed like way too much screwing was going on.

Missy and Dan&#8217;s story has been evolving slowly since Love Like You&#8217;ve Never Been Hurt. I give it a solid 4.5 stars.Overall, I liked the story. I kept waiting for a big conflict that never quite materialized, and that is why I couldn&#8217;t quite give that last half star. I thought a couple elements could have been a little stronger, a little more edgy or angsty, but none of the conflicts seemed to really threaten to keep them apart. But part of me really liked that. It was a love story about two people working out real-life type issues to make a relationship work. I very much liked that Missy and Dan talked to each other and didn&#8217;t have any of those annoying misunderstandings that drive me crazy! It makes it a bit fluffy, so readers who MUST have angst, and want to bite their nails worrying whether or not there will be a Happy Ever After may not find this fits the bill.As with the other Summer Lake books, all the characters in Dance are well drawn, and the repeat characters hold true in all three books. I thought Missy&#8217;s independent and stubborn streak was very realistic, and in her case I actually admire that she just didn&#8217;t jump in and swoon so that Dan would take care of her. I found Dan to be almost too perfect, but I liked him. He wasn&#8217;t too over-the-top beefcake and he seemed very believable to me.Random musing:So Chance, Michael, Smoke and Laura, and Leanne and Ryan.... Each of these characters are very strongly drawn and I&#8217;m assuming their stories will be told in other books. There are very strong (and I&#8217;m assuming deliberate) hints about them, especially Chance and Michael, and I am left with a desire to know what their stories are, and who they are going to end up with.

Heartbreaking and hopeful.There is always the notion of a higher purpose and a refusal to let go. The main characters in these stories are thinkers, dwellers, people seeking answers. They find it impossible to leave the past behind but refuse to let it stand in the way of the world as it is, or will be. A woman, alone in the brutal new apocalyptic world meets a man who ends up protecting their most treasured belonging, a notebook filled with memories of life as it was.Jason Gurley has a gift for dialogue.

During this process Cheryl claims to not only help Leila learn more about her writing technique but also how to search for her story in her everyday life. Leila learns more about herself not only as a writer but as a woman as well. This helps Leila learn what she is willing to give of herself as well as what she is looking for in a man. As Leila learns what she wants and is looking for in a man the hero of her story gets more depth and becomes more engaging to the readers. At this point the only person who is reading her story is Cheryl and this is important to Leila because her option matters when it comes to writing.

Christine, our heroine (a Lt. Colonel in the Army), made a bad choice getting 11 of her troops killed (apparently there are two other events which went bad, but they weren't described) so she kills herself out of guilt, well almost. It's made clear it was no pansy a$$ed attempt so we know her state of mind. The General comes and talks her into joining the team. I don't want to write more about the plot (though children are taken), because it's what develops that is intriguing, it's better the readers discover it on their own.I can't rate it higher because I thought it needed to be fleshed out more. There are actually two entwined stories Christine's and one of the terminal's. I found his to be confusing and the transfer of knowledge from him to Christine unexplained. One minute he's fighting the bad dead guy, then it cuts to Christine in a chopper trying to save people. We're introduced to other characters who are stock characters because Christine can't be the only one looking for the missing kids. How Christine handles some betrayal left me cold too. I would have thought she'd have responded more and try to be more proactive. Why Christine decided to give something to the family of one of her troops isn't clear either. It pops out of no where. The change in the husband's demeanor too facile.Another reviewer mentions that this may be a series.

The main character, Jennifer, heading towards her 21st birthday, is determined to lose her virginity beforehand. Not that she hasn&#8217;t had the chance to do so, just that things always go drastically wrong when the time comes. The moment the book started, Jenn&#8217;s story had me smiling and as you learn the missed opportunities she&#8217;s had to rid herself of her &#8216;V-Card&#8217;, Alicia Michaels provides plenty of moments to laugh at.Fast paced and amusing, there was a lot to love about V-Card. The cast of characters were great to read. I loved Jenn&#8217;s best friends Kinsley and Chloe &#8211; especially Chloe who was so different from the rest with her high fashion and more expensive outlook on life!The comedy in this book was the best part. Right from the beginning, when we learn about Jenn, her clumsiness and unfortunate incidents, V-Card had me laughing. The first half of the book, when Jenn met Dain and things were just as ridiculous for her as she describes in the first chapter, I loved. It was really entertaining and great just to put a smile on your face. As the book went on, though, as enjoyable as it was, I thought the plot became a bit too predictable and as the focus was more on the romance than the comedy, I didn&#8217;t love the second half of the book quite as much.It is a light hearted read though and with a mixture of characters, it&#8217;s easy to make relations from them to yourself or people you know. Chloe reminded me a lot of my best friend and I definitely know someone like Dain too. It was refreshing to read a fun, humorous outlook in a New Adult book rather than the more emotional, grim outlook seen in so many and V-Card was simply an entertaining, very enjoyable romantic comedy.

Mead \"reader-thinker\"", "helpful": [4, 7], "reviewText": "Disclosure: I was so underwhelmed by Amazon's free sample that I did not buy the book, and am evaluating it from the sample. Even the title should have been a sufficient warning to me. Here's why.The author uses the device of portraying those who \"believe\" in global warming as a cult of religious nuts. Cute. Unfortunately, he shows all the characteristics of being an anti-green zealot. It's not long before the reader realizes that Weeks knows enough to throw around key words, but not enough to be in the least factual or truthful.Here's a quote that shows both bad writing and distorted or ignorant \"thinking\":-\"Scientists have been arriving at conclusions of global warming, based on assumptions that are unrealistic. The conclusion arrived by them, is that; the Green House Gases are increasing at an exponential rate. It is known that, water vapor and carbon dioxide are not uniformly distributed, they are distributed irregularly. Yet the effect of water vapor is assumed to be uniformly distributed in most of the mathematical models. When the probability distribution itself is wrong, so would be the mean, variance, standard deviation and whatever can be calculated based on that distribution. Most of these models consider the earth to be flat.\" [Kindle locations 109 ff.]-There are so many grammatical mistakes in this brief passage, I won't take the time to count or discuss them.Do you have any interest in facts or truth? You won't find much of either in this book. Let me illustrate some of the author's exaggerations, mistakes, or outright lies (choose your favorite characterization).\"Green House Gases are increasing at an exponential rate.\" I have not seen any reputable scientist claim exponential growth in greenhouse gases. True, some knowledgeable people are saying that greenhouse gases are growing faster than linearly at present, and there are perfectly good reasons for this to be occurring. If the author thinks somebody knowledgeable is seriously claiming exponential growth indefinitely, I'd like to see a reference and a context for the statement. OK, you say I am quibbling. Let's move on.\"Most of these models consider the earth to be flat.\" This statement is an exaggeration if not completely false. There are a variety of models being used to study climate change. The largest climate models are in fact 3-dimensional and the geometry and inhomogeneities of the earth and its environs are included. Even 1-dimensional modeling is usually done in spherical geometry. I am only aware of a few 0-dimensional models, but even these can be useful under appropriate circumstances. So this is a great sound bite and a very misleading claim.Here's another little passage that has minimal truth value:-\"Only average energy components of green house gases are considered in most of the models. Global warming modeling involves interplay of chemical, physical, biological effects with weather. Since they do not behave linearly with weather, the combined effect is ill-represented by mathematical models, which do not account the non-linearity properly.\" [Kindle locations 115-119]-This proclamation is a multi-target blast, very wide of its targets. First, Weeks objects to using an averaged quantities in a calculation.  In fact, there are many problems in physics that can be solved very well with averaged quantities. Second, he suggests that the models are doomed to inadequacy because not every model includes all processes relevant to the climate problem. He points out that there are even some processes that are not included in any model. Weather itself is one of the factors he uses (erroneously) as an example. Weeks is right that there is no \"complete\" climate model. However, he is wrong in implying that this means the results of the modeling are too inaccurate to be useful. Many technologies we use have been designed with incomplete, approximate models or with suites of interrelated models. A component of the science of building models is to include the most important factors and to make sure the processes omitted are unimportant in determining the key results. One of the ways of establishing the validity of a model is to make detailed experimental comparisons and to understand the differences between model and experimental results. This is done extensively in the field of climatology. Third, and with the least factual basis of all, Weeks claims that the models \"... do not account the non-linearity properly.\" This is actually a central strength of numerical modeling. If the process is linear, there is no need for much assistance from a computer: a little algebra and a calculator suffices. I can't begin to list in this space the long and successful history of applications of numerical modeling to solving non-linear problems. To name a few well-known examples: computer codes have played important roles in designing atomic bombs, nuclear reactors, and airplanes.The author makes wild allegations of a world-wide conspiracy. With so little knowledge of the field, I don't see how Weeks' claims of fraud and conspiracy can carry any weight at all.If you choose to read this book, you would encounter many more falsehoods than truths.

Things are coming together and making sense while still giving Kemp much more story to tell. I was no longer scratching my head wondering what just happened. The characters are more fully developed, and I was better able to connect with them. Plus I was just darn excited to find out what was going to happen next!LeKrista has changed in many ways from the first novel, all for the better, while staying true to herself. Her physical appearance has changed. She doesn't spend so much time passed out, and she's much stronger and quite a fighter this time around. I was happy to delve into LeKrista's family history, and as I got to know her and her family, I felt more connected to her in this book than in the first one. When she begins having disturbing nightmares where she's emotionally devastated over and over again, I wanted to kill the person hurting her in those nightmares. I wanted her to get revenge in those terrible dreams. They affected me in a way that made me want to cry for her.In Hunted, I learned more about Pierce and why he's been keeping a huge secret - he's more than human but can't tell LeKrista until they're married and have consummated the marriage. I think this is really interesting and different from other stories. The heat between Pierce and LeKrista has been turned all the way up! In the first book, their relationship seemed blah and lifeless. I wondered why they were even together, so I was excited to see they are passionately in love.I'm still not sold on Roman's character. Different characters have been snarky to LeKrista about choosing to associate with Roman, but really, he came for her to protect her. She didn't seek him out. I don't trust Roman; I think he pretends to love LeKrista because he wants the very same thing as the vampire he created - to use her to take over the world so vampires don't have to hide from humans any longer, not to mention the fact that Vampires, Mages, Werewolves, and Shapeshifters are all vying for power.For the minor characters, I love Tate the most. She's become LeKrista's best friend. Craven, the daywalker, is a new and interesting character thrown into the mix. He's a welcome addition to the cast of characters, and as a daywalker, he differs from vampires in a few ways that I thought were really cool. Lizette is just plain annoying. Shouldn't she blame the one who turned her into a vampire rather than LeKrista? Sometimes her vendetta felt like a repeat of when Perdita was after LeKrista. When it comes to Eddy I'm torn - much of the time I don't like him, but then he'll say or do something that makes me think it's possible I'll end up liking him.I'm still trying to understand the Mages. LeKrista learned she's a powerful Mage. Since she's a Mage as well as her family, why won't the Mages help her? I understand they don't like that LeKrista has been mixed into vampire affairs, but I'd think they would want to help untangle her from all that. Xiomara, who is one of the most powerful Mages and the one who seems to be in charge, has a cold heart. I think she's afraid of LeKrista's power.With time, memories, and events shifting all around, characters with magical powers, and mysteries to be unlocked, Hunted is a book not to be missed.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "blew the first book out of the water!!", "unixReviewTime": 1400371200, "reviewTime": "05 18, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A3EGSF3GF2PUS9", "asin": "B00JPW07L6", "reviewerName": "taxlady", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "I just didn't feel personally involved with her in this book.

The cover was pretty good, and the blurb sounded pretty damn good.  By the time I finished the book, I was excited and eager for book two.  I haven't really seen anything that says there will for sure be a book two, but I am crossing my fingers!So this story starts out with Charla, who is a home nurse.  She's just answered a newspaper ad put out by a man who meets her on the porch wearing cowboy boots and a bathrobe - his name is Jack.  He hires her on the spot, and then chapter one brings us to the present. Anyway - back to Charla.  She's pretty okay.  She's not my favorite heroine, but she isn't the worst.  She's a strong woman with a douchey ex in her past, and you know how that goes.  She's working on herself, which is all well and good until Liam steps into play.Now Liam, Liam I liked.  Bartender slash bounty hunter slash all around good guy.  He's ex military and he likes life with a bit of an edge.  He's definitely likable as a character, and by the end of the book I was hooked on him.This book had a bit of the instant chemistry going on in the beginning, and it felt like it was more a part of the &#34;formula&#34; than something that was actually happening.  In fact, there were times that I felt Liam and Charla didn't get along at all, even without any chemistry.  And then the next moment they were very into each other.  But whatever, it didn't kill the story for me.  And actually, as the book goes on, things did begin to gel a bit more, and I was impressed.So anyways, Jack wants Charla to deliver a letter upon his death to Liam.  And that sparks off a ton of events that involve the mafia, lies, and a lot of action. The story moved quick and was exciting. I don't generally read mafia related books, but lately it seems I've been totally into the Irish and mafia.  Go figure.I love the way that family threads it's way through the entire story.  Just when you think you've seen it all, here's another branch on the tree.  And the Irish heritage that binds the guys together plays out very well.  There is one character in the story, who shall remain nameless at this point, who just kind of took off at the end of the book.  He's the reason I am hoping for another book.  It just felt... I don't know, swept under the rug and not really handled well.Anyhow - this book definitely has some different twists, and I would recommend it for a quick read!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Slow Start but really picks up!", "unixReviewTime": 1398038400, "reviewTime": "04 21, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A10DZ0VS7INN49", "asin": "B00JQMXDTS", "reviewerName": "Twin Opinions", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "I was not expecting this book to captivate me so much.

And breathless.  Not unlike the air that tickles the wings of the eagles as they soar high above the mountains, in the final scene.And what can I say about the talent of Ms. Dez Burke, that hasn't been said before?  Very little.  But I can talk about her use of visual, gustatory, olfactory, and kinesthetic imagery.  I can talk about her use of humor.  Property of Flint?  Now, that is hilarious; I'm still chuckling at the thought.  And I can talk about the romance between Flint and Kendra, that starts in Safe House, the first book in the series (get your copy if you haven't done so, as yet) and which grows and cements itself in this story.Yes, the sex scenes are peppered throughout the story, but Liberated is much more than an erotic read.  I learned about the care of animals, not just dogs or cats that we read about in every other book, but about animals that one may not even give a second thought.  It's the first time I read a romance that touches on the care of squirrels, and hawks. This also hints at Ms. Burke's care for such creatures, for all creatures in fact, great or small.And I got to learn about MC subculture.  Who wants to be labeled an 'old lady'?  Apparently, many a Sweet Butt, or an aspiring one. To be called such is not demeaning. I never knew that holding such a title is an honorable thing!  Wow!Liberated is certainly an excellent installment of the Steel Infidels series.  There is love, laughter, drama and suspense.  It also highlights the plight of underage girls who are used as mere pawns.Of course, I continue to look forward to reading more stories in this series.  I still would like to see Jesse get his own story, because he's been through a lot.  I would like to see Flint's youngest brother, Sam, settle the heck down.  And I would like to see the Liberators get their just desserts.Liberated is certainly another excellent tale, written by an exceptionally talented author.Don't waste another second.  Get your copy!

With each story she writes, they always contain characters (both main and support) who are not only extremely likable but also draw me into their lives feeling as though I am a close friend.  I no longer pause to read the synopsis but go straight to the 1-click button to purchase it without a second thought.  When I became aware of her newest novel, Sandcastle Kisses, I of course jumped at the opportunity to read it.Isabel (Izzy) Baker is a marine biologist working and doing research in Key Island in the Caribbean who agrees to moonlight one night as a bartender for a private party.  Izzy never anticipated the possibility of anything more than an opportunity to earn extra money.  That is until she meets Noah, a tourist visiting the island with whom she is assigned to work.  Although she feels an attraction to Noah, Izzy has been burned by tourists in the past so continues to remind herself to keep her distance knowing he will be gone in only a few days.  But as the evening draws to an end, Izzy struggles with the uncertainty that she may not be able to resist his charm and wit, not to mention the fact that he is gorgeous.Noah is actually not a bartender but a rich and powerful business man who was asked to attend the party being thrown by an old college friend.  Upon meeting Izzy, Noah is engulfed into her spectacular world of marine biology and research and is unable to let her go.  But when Noah's world of business and Izzy's world of marine research meet head-on, will their love and passion continue to encompass their hearts or will it be washed away?From the inception of this story, I was drawn into the lives of both Noah and Izzy.  Not surprisingly, Ms. Lakes has again taken pen to paper (figuratively, of course) and written an enjoyable and entertaining story, and hot and sexy one as well.  As always, I found myself struggling with my self-control to keep from flipping to the last chapter on my Kindle just to put my mind at ease and ensure that I would be given the happily-ever-after ending that I am always hoping to find.Once again Krista Lakes has wowed me with Sandcastle Kisses.  Although it is part of her Kisses series, it can be read as a standalone novel.  This book tells a delightfully lovely story, and if you are like me and love Ms. Lakes' Kisses series, I would recommend you not let this one pass you by.  But even if you have not yet had an opportunity to read any of Ms. Lakes' stories, Sandcastle Kisses will beguile and gratify anyone in search of a sweet and romantic tale of finding love.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Beguiling and Romantic", "unixReviewTime": 1403568000, "reviewTime": "06 24, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "AARH1Y1HWY7UO", "asin": "B00JRBN26M", "reviewerName": "Terry", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "In &#34;Sandcastle Kisses&#34; we meet Isabel Baker a marine biologist who is moonlighting as a bartender on a beautiful island, this is where she meets Noah, the charismatic billionaire who gets under her skin and sweeps her off of her feet.

This book was an interesting read. It did not go where I expected it to go, but I loved every minute of the ride. Stone broke formula, both &#8220;romance&#8221; formula, and patterns he had set with the first two books in the Uniformity series (Compromised and Damaged). You, also, don&#8217;t expect to like the main character as much as you do. He is an ex-con, after all.You first meet Dylan Hoss in Damaged. He is a model prisoner and comes to the aid of correctional officer Zane Davis, who is being railroaded by a prison gang and prison officials. I was intrigued to see just how Dylan was going to get his Happily Ever After, being a prisoner and all. I do not often go for the prisoner as the MC, but Stone proved me wrong with book 1, so I decided to give it another try. I enjoyed this book even more. It is my favorite of the series.I found tears pricking my eyes and my heart strings tugging for Hoss when he loses Joey. I found myself yelling at the author for that, as well. I found myself profoundly confused by the pairing of Dylan and Keegan. Yes, Keegan was hot, but he was no Joey. I found the characters once again surrounded by awesome friends. I loved Maggie for her unwavering support of Dylan and Al for his unwavering love of Maggie. I found myself wanting Dylan to make it for the long haul.

Both center around some sort of celebrity, both have tons of skanky fans all too eager to sell their souls for a few intimate moments with the star, then you get the egos and sense of entitlement. Why one works for me and the other doesn't is a mystery. I think Sliding Into Home's hero Greg, may hold a bit of the answer. And it comes down to perception. Mine, his, the fans, heck the world in general. The whole story is based on Greg's perception of himself, his father, his relationship with Jenn, and how he wishes to be perceived as well. Am I getting to Zen? Ahhh, well, I'm in a mood.In what was basically a lighthearted, fun sports romance with a thread of serious undertone, I of course decide to pick at the thread. While Greg is determined to step out of the shadow of his father and be his own man, everything he has done to this point in his life has sabotaged his efforts. He is certainly headed in the right direction now, but he still has a chip that's weighing him down. Enter Jenn.Again with the perceptions. She at first perceives Greg as a spoiled, entitled playboy. She looks deeper and adjusts. Yaaay! Buuuut....... she plays into Greg's perception of her as the lawyer/stripper. It made for a truly fun read. Watching the characters grow not only into a couple but into better people. So you can take what you want from Sliding Into Home, a lighthearted romance with hot sex and warm fuzzies, or a study in how we feel about others perceptions and how it effects our own.

He came out to his parents in his teens and apart from a narcissistic grandmother everyone offered him kindness and support. He strongly believes in the myths and destiny of a shifter and is patiently waiting for his mate but is terrified at the thought of living his life alone or worse still his chosen mate will be a womanWhen he first smells then meets Robert Cimino all his senses are overwhelmed. This gorgeous man who is only passing through his small town is a bear shifter and his mate. The more Vy sees of Robert the more confused he becomes and he can&#8217;t help but wonder why this big bear of a man isn&#8217;t drawn to him by their mating bond.The stress and worry that Vy has placed on himself over the whole mating thing has left him lacking in compassion when it comes to other members of his Ket. This only increases when he meets Robert and discovers that the bear shifter actually refuses to shift&#8230;ever!  Vy doesn&#8217;t understand this and his ideas are so ingrained he can&#8217;t see a way of them ever being together if their mating bond is not completed.Robert is of a very different opinion and believes it is how the man feels about the other person that is important and not the animal. He is so far removed from his animal side that all he feels is fear when he think about the bear inside of him. He wants Vy to see him for what he is and not what he believes he should be. He is also terrified of what his bear will do should he ever release him.With or without being mated the two men are very strongly attracted to each other and the sex is hot with a taste of D/s.For their relationship to work they will be both have to open up to sides of themselves that they are afraid to show and even if that happens will Vy be enough to keep Robert in one place and cure his need to never put down roots or stay in one place.

I really enjoyed reading this lovely novella.Pippa was a great heroine. She was determined to to things on her own terms, refusing to bow to the demands of others. She was clever, though oddly unconcerned about her reputation, and her antics brought a lot of fun to the book. I thought she was lovely.Lucas seemed like a domineering jerk at first, to be brutally honest. But, as the book went on, we see why he acted the way he did and that there was a whole lot more to him than what he showed. Underneath all that strict control, he was very sweet, protective of his loved ones, and determined to ensure his family's fortune after his father squandered it. I really liked him. He was rather adorable.The romance was lovely. Pippa and Lucas were great together. I wasn't really feeling it, though, because Pippa spent most of her time focused on defying Lucas and Lucas spent most of his time trying to keep control. But, I thought it was sweet that, despite all that, their feelings for each other still grew. Not to mention the sizzling chemistry between them. Overall, I thought they were a wonderful couple.The plot was well paced and I was kept interested the entire way through.

First off I have to say the end of this novel left me saying, &#8220;Wow, just wow!&#8221; This story definitely takes you on a whirlwind of emotions because of the roller coaster these characters go on while dealing with feelings and the relationships they are involved in.  As with the first novel, you will also get this story in multiple P.O.V&#8217;s, eight P.O.V.&#8217;s to be exact from:  Piper, Mason, Lexi, Jake, Jax, Ryker, Hannah and Brooke.On a flight to see her long time friend Lexi&#8217;s special day, red-haired beauty Piper Shores, had no clue how an obnoxious hot guy she meets on the flight would become more than she expected.  After an eventful weekend of wedded bliss and new acquaintances, Piper gets back to her life as a waitress at a local Denver sports bar with her co-worker and friend Hannah.  She becomes intertwined in an unexpected relationship with a sweet-loving southern guy named Jax, who she starts to fall for quickly.  But Mason, with his alpha-male persona, seems to make her feel strong confusing emotions and won&#8217;t stop pursuing her once he realized that she makes him feel alive again.Mason is Jake&#8217;s best friend and a professional football player in Denver.  He met a female who was dressed with a hoodie and sun-shades, on his flight to be the best man in a wedding. After meeting Piper, he comes to the conclusion that she is rude but one sexy woman.  Mason likes how Piper seems to make him feel alive again after having had his heart ripped out by his ex-fiance Brooke.  Even though it takes him a little time to finally realize that Piper is who he wants, he has to deal with the fact that he might not be able to completely have her.  But the one thing about Mason, is that he is determined to make Piper his.Then, you have Hannah, Piper&#8217;s co-worker and friend.  She&#8217;s sweet, nice and a good-girl who is dating a guy who she sees when he&#8217;s not away for business.  Once she meets Ryker, Masons teammate and friend, he begins to never stop letting Hannah know that he&#8217;s interested in her. She is determined to wait faithfully for her boyfriend Todd, for the day that he&#8217;ll propose to her.  Ryker on the other hand, is determined to make Hannah see that she should be his and until then, he offers her friendship.In &#8216;Double Coverage&#8217; you&#8217;ll get a chance to get to know all of the characters well. We get to experience the relationships as they blossom and we witness some as they are destroyed.  As the reader, you&#8217;ll sometimes feel at odds about which people belong together.  These characters seem so realistic because of their imperfections, their emotional turmoil and the choices they make while trying to figure out what they truly want.  And let me warn you&#8230;there are many moments of hot interactions, filled with body on body,  steaminess that will leave you breathless and make your toes curl.Will Piper stay with her safe and sweet boyfriend Jax or will she follow her strong feelings for the hot-alpha-male Mason? Can Hannah stay happy waiting for Todd or will Ryker&#8217;s persistence pay off and win Hannah over?  Find out where Brooke and a hot model named Ashlin fit into the equation.  I recommend this book because it&#8217;s from a great new series and the characters of the the story keep you interested in seeing where the story will take each of them. The ending is left good and ready for the follow-up novel of this series!

But I bought and read this book in its original release version, that is the version I'm reviewing.In this story we get to see the humanization of Sorilla Aida. She's always been an incredibly interesting character that was well developed, but now we get a peek at her motivations and the heartache caused by some of her previous missions. The plot itself was another highlight as we get to see the Alliance as an imperfect political conglomeration of separate worlds that seem to only be members because of a fear of two powerful species that keep each other in check. Even though Currie seemed to be pre-apologizing for this story in the foreword, I found it compelling and a great introduction into what I assume will be a interesting continuation of the series.So, there were many, many high points to this story. Frankly, they were the only reason I kept reading and the only reason this book gets three stars and not one. The bad? There was at LEAST one significant error on every single page, and that is no exaggeration. These ranged from wrong word used, missing words, repeated words, misspelled words, wrong names used for characters and alien species, capitalization errors, punctuation errors.... It was so bad I refuse to believe that this wasn't just a rough draft that got tossed up for sale. This would have been bad for even a first time author offering his/her work for .99, but this is a well established author writing in a well established series and charging $5 a pop. It's an insult to the readers that he couldn't be bothered to make sure the book was edited and polished before it went up on sale. Now here's the kicker... this is the exact same problem with the previous book in this series. That one was also simply loaded with errors that were corrected at a later date. (I pulled my review of that book since the author decided to attack the review in the comments section and it was a conversation I had no interest engaging in.)Currie is one of the more imaginative authors out right now, but presenting such an unprofessional product while simultaneously charging premium prices for a self-published work is a habit I don't find endearing.

Kady and Colton knew each other well thanks to him being her big brother&#8217;s best friend, and they clicked on a level that made everyone else pale in comparison. And after a stolen moment that left her panting, for Kady no one lived up to Colton in other ways, too.  It was one of those maddening &#8220;almost&#8221; situations, where Kady got left in the lurch wondering what went wrong and Colton swore to never let his guard down again&#8230;but when two people fit so well together, it&#8217;s hard to fight all of that pent-up passion!I really liked Colton and Kady together.  Even though there wasn&#8217;t a lot of time for detailed back story, we get enough of their relationship to see why they click and what draws them to each other.  They think a lot alike, which makes them work well together both in their career choice and their personal lives.  The issue with them vying for the same contract wasn&#8217;t a huge factor in the storyline, which meant more time spent on their interactions as Colton tried to deny how much he wanted to have his way with Kady&#8230;so big plus in that column!! Kady was a smart, strong gal though, and I definitely enjoyed her personality.What was cool about this story was that it's more than your typical 'guy trying to deny his feelings for his friend&#8217;s sis'.  Colton wasn&#8217;t just the bad boy who didn&#8217;t think he was worthy, though there was some of that.  He also had some&#8230;needs&#8230;that weren&#8217;t what a woman would normally expect or be into, so he feared both hurting Kady and scaring her off.  Your heart kind of has to go out to the guy; I mean, rough play is certainly sexy but it&#8217;s not really the norm, so when Colton judges himself for wanting Kady that way it&#8217;s understandable.  But he&#8217;s smoking hot and even more so when his dominating alpha side came into play, so I certainly wouldn&#8217;t have been complaining!!Overall, this was a fun and sexy read that I devoured in one sitting, so a definite recommend from me!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Sexy quickie!", "unixReviewTime": 1400716800, "reviewTime": "05 22, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A320QB8QO0OTPT", "asin": "B00JTIZV2Q", "reviewerName": "Artfullee", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "3.5 starsTucker and Sophie's story is the second in the Paint River Ranch series and I started this immediately after reading Cole's story in Book 1.

Tucker, however, who is used to quick hook-ups with no promise of tomorrow, feels a pull towards Sophie but goodbyes are said and they part ways.

Needless to say, they still feel a connection, but I didn't quite feel it all the time. Once they connected I wanted to feel it all the time.What seems like a sweet, easy romance turns out to be quite an emotional ride. The story is written in dual POV's which I really appreciated.

Once again, Leigh uses alternating first-person voice, telling this story through the eyes of Adriana Dostovsky, Luca Martuccio and Nikolai Belikov, characters that were introduced in the first book in the Musical Intrude series, The Prelude.At twenty-one, Adriana is at a crossroads in her life. While she is trying to become a lead ballerina, Adriana&#8217;s love life is going nowhere. Adriana has had eyes for Nikolai ever since he saved her while her family was escaping from her father and Russia years ago. She tries everything to get Nikolai to see her as a woman and not as a little girl any more. Thanks to the alternating viewpoints, the reader knows that Nikolai very much want to be with Adriana in just he way she wants, but he fears that she cannot handle his darker passions. Doing what he thinks is best, Nikolai pushes Adriana away, realizing too late that he will really lose her. Adriana, to her credit, moves on and turns her attention to Luca, the other man who has caught her eye. Luca is completely enraptured by Adriana and sees her as his next conquest. Because Adriana hopes to lose her virginity with Luca, she agrees to go on a five-day trip to Venice with Luca and his family. During this trip, Adriana and Luca&#8217;s heartfelt conversations about their past hurts bring them closer together and quickly change their relationship; they are falling in love. While in Venice, Adriana gets to know Simona, Luca&#8217;s mother, and experiences firsthand what a mother-daughter relationship should be like. Especially since her own mother, Katerina, is a controlling and vindictive character that you just love to hate. Unfortunately secrets, lies, and intimidation threaten to break up this young couple. During their separation, Nikolai hopes that Adriana will return to him, but Luca is really her true love. The beauty in this story comes from Adriana and Luca learning to forgive, trust, and truly love one another. Furthermore, they realize that together they can do anything, which makes them a couple to cheer for. Leigh does a masterful job of showing how all of these characters grow throughout the story. Adriana&#8217;s growth is the most stunning, as she absolutely sheds the scared little girl to become a strong-minded woman.Passionate, memorable characters who experience intense emotional development make An Aria in Venice hard to put down.I received an eBook copy of the book for the purpose of an honest review.

He loves her back fiercely but refuses to admit it to her. Determined to get her mind of off him, she agrees to join the gorgeous and sexy playboy Luca and his family in Venice. He was only supposed to get her mind off of Nikolai, not fall in love with her and steal her heart. And Nikolai? Now that Adriana has the chance to be happy with someone else, he&#8217;s ready to fight for her. But so is Luca&#8230;&#8220;I can see you for who you truly are, Adriana Dostovsky.&#8221;&#8212;LucaAh, what a sweet song. When I picked up this book, I was expecting a light-hearted and simple story where the sweet girl reforms the playboy and happily ever after. Instead, I got a complicated tale with a strong heroine, her scandalous family, a super sexy and challenging love triangle, and an emotional storyline. I didn&#8217;t want to put this book down!You can pretty much apply the phrase &#8220;poor little rich girl&#8221; to our heroine Adriana in that she&#8217;s rich and well loved by everyone but still unhappy. Not that anyone would know it. She hides her pain away and clings to what makes her feel safe&#8212;like Nikolai who has given everything up to protect her. Her mother is dismissive of her while being controlling and her mobster father is nowhere to be seen. I love how feisty and adorable she is despite her notorious and over-protective family. She goes after what she wants and yet she&#8217;s fiercely loyal to and protective about those she cares about. It&#8217;s easy to see why she catches both Nikolai&#8217;s and Luca&#8217;s heart!Oh, and what a sexy conundrum (a high heat one on the romance scale)! Do you go with the gorgeous sex god with assassin tendencies who has protected you during your worst nightmares? Or do you go with the gorgeous sex god with poetic tendencies who makes those nightmares fade? Usually in love triangles, there&#8217;s a clear cut answer who the winner will be. In this case, I really wasn&#8217;t sure while reading through most of the book, and I loved not knowing! I would flip back and forth between the two as secrets were revealed and feelings shared. Oh&#8230;dear&#8230;what a lucky girl&#8212;or I guess unlucky for having to choose between two men who love her fiercely. Nope, I&#8217;ll stick with the first statement and call her lucky.I loved the story, particularly the part in Venice where Luca and Adriana fall for each other. Told in the viewpoints of the three main characters, we really get to know them, which makes her choosing one so difficult! There&#8217;s also another story going on with Adriana&#8217;s brother and love interest that seemed kinda random, but I&#8217;m guessing it&#8217;s because he has his own book and the stories are happening concurrently so we&#8217;re getting snippets of it. We also get some background on Luca&#8217;s fascinating brothers, so I&#8217;m assuming they&#8217;ll be getting their own books one day, too (crossing fingers)!

Rather than write an overall review for the entire book that won't do the four unique stories justice, I thought it might be better to rate and review each one.The Golem of Mala Lubovnya by Kim Fielding: 4.5 starsThere was such depth created by the author for such a short story. It had a dark, gothic and gritty feel and yet, the relationship was loving, sweet and very real. It felt like a folktale with this giant creature that was created to ensure the safety of the town. As the tale develops, we find out there's a lot more depth to golem's character than his master had intended.Oh, how I adored Emet and Jakob's slow-building relationship and their discovery of each other. Everything about them felt real and believable. From Emet's secret admiration of Jakob to the way they slowly built a friendship that turned into more.Watchworks by Jamie Fessenden: 5 stars!This is my first read by Jamie Fessenden and it certainly won't be my last! The steampunk worldbuilding was fantastic. I could see and feel the era and atmosphere without a lot of time devoted to the descriptions. It was all shown through the characters' dialogue and interactions.Harland and Luke's romance was full of emotion and discovery. The way Luke 'required' Harland's help weekly was cute since we know that he knew exactly what he was doing. Even though he was pretty innocent, he found something that he wanted and he went for it. He was just a great character.Reparation by Eli Easton: 3 starsAnother good story for this anthology, although not quite as good as the others. I loved the sci-fi setting and how the recons were made and used. Some interesting stuff right there!What I wasn't feeling was the relationship. Knox and Edward were on their way to being a great couple before they had their big fallout. I guess I didn't like how things were resolved between them. It all seemed rather melodramatic and caused some major eye-rolling. It didn't fit with the rest of the story.Made For Aaron by Sue Brown: 3.5 starsI keep going back and forth on my rating here. I'm waffling between 5 stars and 2 stars. Not too many warring emotions, right?I loved that this story was so different. All the stories are outside my norm, but the plot in this one really struck me. I can't even begin to imagine how Aaron was feeling seeing his husband of 10 years walk away from him willingly, but the author captured his emotions perfectly and I could really feel his devastation. I don't agree with Aaron's choices but can see where he was coming from.On the other hand, Aaron had no one else besides his husband in his life and would keep telling people, 'we didn't need anyone but each other'. Uh, dude, yeah ya do. He was very immature when it came to other relationships in his life, or lack thereof. He really rubbed me the wrong way sometimes.But it ended up being a great ending to a fabulous collection of dark and gothic love stories.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great read!", "unixReviewTime": 1401840000, "reviewTime": "06 4, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A2I58O8E2AVBZM", "asin": "B00JU8H7R2", "reviewerName": "madpuss", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "I like how Sami belongs to a very loving, close knit family, who actually like to spend time together.

In Dead Spot readers meet the heroine, Scarlett&#8217;s roommate Molly&#8230;but we never knew how they came to be roomies.  Sell-by Date answers that precise question, how did Scarlett and Molly meet?Sell-by Date is narrated by the oh-so-funny Molly as she navigates the human world and the new L.A. scene. You see, Molly was turn when she was 17-years-old and even though she is about 90 &#8230;she can&#8217;t order a beer or stay out late after curfew without having the cops card her. I really enjoyed reading this short story and seeing a different side to Molly. In Dead Spot, Molly came off as a fun and outgoing roommate that kind of roomed with Scarlett so that she may &#8216;age&#8217; (because any supernatural being that comes within a 15 mile radius of Scarlett becomes normal/human again). While that is definitely one of the reasons why, it turns out there&#8217;s another entirely different reason why Molly so desperately wanted Scarlett as a roommate.I loved Molly ever since I met her in Dead Spots, and after reading Sell-by Date I would really like to read more of the old world from Molly&#8217;s POV. I think the author is planning to write a spin-off from her Scarlett Bernard series, so finger crosses that Molly gets a full book! I highly recommend this short story to already fans of Scarlett or if you&#8217;re interested in checking out the series (Dead Spot, book 1) this is a great introduction to the world, characters, and the author&#8217;s writing.

Such is the case for me with Sasha, Stefan, and Charles in the latest KF Breene series. The third installment in this story was released yesterday, and I happily and greedily got sucked back into their world.This is a compelling series, full of mythological creatures and beings remade so skillfully that they seem normal. Paranormal and fantasy isn't my favorite genre, because it takes a skilled writer with a firm grasp of reality to write a story that seems legitimate and relatable. KF Breene is exactly that kind of writer, and I thoroughly enjoy reading everything she writes.On A Razor's Edge picks up more or less where Braving the Elements left off, with Stefan and Sasha totally in love and screwing every chance they get. With the much anticipated arrival of the Regional - essentially the Boss's boss - we see Stefan in a whole new light, and learn more about how Stefan's people fit into our world. There is also another species of almost-humans and a road trip involved. Lots of magic, lots of information, lots of fun.Honestly, the real world seems pretty boring and staid in comparison.The more I read this series, the more intrigued I get. Yes, I love the hot sex and the proliferation of physical beauty, but it is the magical power and the non-human creatures that really fascinates me. I am a bit wistful for their almost-real world, and after each book I look at our world a bit differently.

If you haven't read the first book I really recommend; Wes and Braden were secondary characters, but their story began in Collide.This book is slightly different in that both characters are comfortable with their sexuality. But ultimately the same message is reinforced. Love is love, and this is shown perfectly by the fact that Braden is bi-sexual and it's simply a case of him waiting to find the one, be it a man or a woman. The man is a treasure; witty, fun, kind and thoughtful, he inserts his foot into his mouth regularly and is completely endearing with it. Wes is struggling; everyone he loves has left him in some way or another and following his sister's death, he is raising her four year old daughter. He is full of fear and self-doubt, but he simply needs someone to make him see what a stellar job he is doing. And that man is Braden.Kids can either make or break a book; they can be ridiculously unrealistic, or perfect. Jessie is the latter. Her world is untainted, as it is to all four year olds. She says what she sees and thinks and her growing relationship with Braden bring so many moments that made me smile. She is a sweet loveable little lady.My heart ached for Wes and his fears and I wanted to throw my arms around Braden and squeeze him tightly for his patience, understanding and sweet gestures. And when Wes lets his barriers down, he too is a wonderful, witty man. You can't not want them to find happiness and it is this that makes for another captivating read.

An ambitious young reporter takes a dangerous and terrifying journey to the remotest parts of the world.  Brooke Kinely receives information from a source in the Pentagon of a high ranking businessman's part in terrorism.  A sophisticated weapon wipes out a U.S army patrol and Brooke tries to uncover a traitor and stop a devastating attack on America.The author throws you straight into the action, which continues and even gets more exciting.  The main players are authentic and technical aspects are obviously well researched.  Bond&#8217;s creativity leads the reader to conjure up pictures with just enough descriptive writing without being too bogged down with detail.  I love conspiracy theory, spy, political espionage, action, and suspense.  All of these are in this book and more.  Add a little personal experience and travel of A.S. Bond to the exciting mix.

She has two daughters Lindsey and Lauren and has a loving family like many others. She feels lead to open her family up to give others that love that so many deserve but are not getting. Her family proceeds the action to adopt a child from Guatemala and before they know it their son Cameron is added to their family. The love for this child is instant. Love of another can occur whether biological or not biological. We are all God's children so the reason for that is simple. Not long after that Lindsey is diagnosed with Tourette Syndrome which leads them to homeschooling. Nancy's husband Rusty is a doctor and so that provides them with some comfort.Little did they know that their lives were about to change in a big way. God was leading them to a little Girl in China named Candace Kate. They went to China to pick up Candace but when they got there they found out that she was deaf. The family felt lead by God to continue the adoption. Little did they know the challenges they would face as Candace was more than deaf. Later they would find that she had a rare disease called Batten Disease. This disease does not have a cure and so the story really begins as Nancy takes us through the rest of Candace's life, which is filled with Dr. appointments, therapy's and lots of question. Nancy is upfront with her feelings of frustration and hope as she shares some of her personal thoughts.This is a very gut wrenching story.

I also have close family member with Cancer and although that was a fight I still have that family member. I could however relate  to the many medical appointments and the feelings of being angry with God. I appreciate Nancy sharing her story. I think that handling a child with terminal illness is completely different than an adult and so with that I hope that her story will help another.

They all share their Egyptian heritage, Jewish faith, and the rut of a daily routine in a retirement community.  One morning, Mel wakes to find his wife, Judith, gone.  There is no note, no sign of a disturbance, but Judith and some of her favorite things have disappeared.Suddenly alone, Mel grapples with losing his wife, the ambiguity of her disappearance, his family, and what he wants to do with what is left with his life.  He sets off on an adventure, only to be forced to return home and experience another adventure, but one not of his choosing.Century Village is a fun story, and the author does a fine job of making the characters come alive--in some ways, they are the stereotype of a Florida retiree, but in other ways, each has their own unique voice.

Don&#8217;t get me wrong the grammar is more professional than the book cover but the author needs to take some time learning how to tell a story which is more important. I can only image the glowing reviews are left by friends and family. Where I had to force my way through because I thought maybe it would get better but it was slow and boring the whole time. The characters were boring, I would rather hang out with my grandmother and listen to her tell me about knitting, I wasted a week of my life trying to trudge through this never again.I&#8217;m pissed I wasted my money on this because I trusted the recommendation from a friend who was apparently just trying to support another friend in their attempt to write a book. Mainly the book was just EXTREMELY BORING if I had to sum up on one word that is the word it would be. I&#8217;ll give actual reasons though but since there are many to choose from I&#8217;ll only use a few.So here are some clips of how horribly exciting this character and her life are.&#8220;I wondered if Josh would be much longer. How typical that the one night I didn&#8217;t want to be stuck in the office was the one night I was forced to wait for him. It had been a long week and I was tired.&#8221;That is for real in the book. Office lady who has to wait for someone she doesn&#8217;t want to wait for. I read books to escape the boredom of real life not to be told about some fake two dimensional character&#8217;s same boring experiences. Grabbing a coffee from the break room at my day job is more thrilling than this character&#8217;s life for most of the book.And overwritten sentences, &#8220;He raised an eyebrow at me questioningly.&#8221; Where was the editor for this book or was there one?The worst part was all the boring summaries like these, &#8220;Josh chose that moment to walk back in. We ate our food in relative silence. I picked at mine, moving it around inside its foil tray but not really eating it. Josh didn&#8217;t finish his either, and fed the rest of it to Connor.&#8221;Are you still awake reading this? I don&#8217;t think the author was while writing it.And passages where the author tells you about relationships. Where is the character development? &#8220;Robert&#8217;s interest in me had always been odd. I&#8217;d never understood it, but when it was nothing more than messages on my answer machine I could ignore it. I&#8217;d had other things on my mind, things that consumed me.&#8221;This is the character&#8217;s problems. In a word, boring.Then when the characters are in stressful situation the passage is written with complete lack of emotion, like this, &#8220;The light from the lake was all but gone, leaving us in subtle darkness. She appeared human again, her strange countenance vanished. Even her snowy gown had been blown away by Josh&#8217;s words.&#8221;It&#8217;s not bad writing, well maybe a little &#8220;Even her snowy gown had been blown away by Josh&#8217;s words&#8221; is flowery, but mostly the problem is its just emotionless. Something crazy happens and the character talks about it with the same passion one talks about a cloudy day in June. The last couple chapters were the only parts where the story was even remotely interesting but the writing was so devoid of passion that it fell flat and I didn&#8217;t connect. It didn&#8217;t seem real. Things like that don&#8217;t happen and people just be like, oh this happened.Sorry to be so bitter, I hate being ripped off so don&#8217;t blame me. Maybe she has more friends who will like this book but why can&#8217;t authors share their books with friends without pretending it&#8217;s a real book and then people waste money buying it. If you aren&#8217;t her friend and considering reading this just be smarter than me and read a sample first, I knew it was going to suck once I started reading but thought it would get better. It did at the end but not good enough to be worth paying for.The best thing about this book was the end but only because it meant it was finally over. I can&#8217;t believe I finished reading this. I will not be reading more by this author and the friend that recommended this, last time I take his advice on books if he can&#8217;t be honest and is going to try to sell me books that suck just because he knows the person that wrote it.

It's the fourth of five books in the Emerald Springs Legacy continuity series and I have only also read the prequel, Trouble Brewing, not the rest of the series itself. Ms. Flockton smoothly includes enough character development of Daniel's brothers, family, and friends that I felt I knew them and I had no problem enjoying the story, even without reading the other books in the continuity yet.DANIEL'S DECISION is about Daniel Whitman, who is in charge of the family's resort hotel in Emerald Springs and the last of the three brothers to remain a bachelor. He has great fun teasing his brothers, especially Chad, for having fallen in love. He feels safe doing so since he is convinced he'll never be bitten by that bug. Daniel has plans to expand the services the family's resort offers in order to attract a more discriminating level of clients. He has heard great things about some innovative changes Kulang, a resort hotel in Australia, has made and decides to take a trip for research. The moment he arrives he meets Rochelle Harris and knows he'll do most anything to get to know her better while he's visiting Australia.Rochelle is the marketing manager at the Kulang and it is her ideas that have brought so much recent growth and success to the resort. She is a strong, ambitious and fiercely independent woman who is solely focused on advancing in her career with no time for men. It's impossible not to admire her and root for her happiness and success, she came from a rough beginning and has made her accomplishments all on her own. She tried having a romantic relationship once before and it left her with nothing but a broken heart and a threat to her career advancement. The minute she sees Daniel she knows he'll be nothing but trouble for her and vows to avoid him.Daniel, the sworn bachelor, is almost immediately smitten with Rochelle, who as fate would have it tries every trick she can to avoid him. One, because she doesn't trust herself considering the intense attraction she feels for him and two, she knows he's from a competitive resort and believes he's there as a spy to smooth talk her out of trade secrets. Daniel although usually all about business is more interested in smooth talking Rochelle into his bed. The draw between these two is irresistible and the chemistry magnetic. It's a sweet story and so well told.  Rochelle doesn't make it easy for Daniel and there's a bit of a hiccup before they can work things out, but Ms. Flockton does in the end give us a glorious HEA. Thankfully so, because Daniel and Rochelle are perfect as a couple and their love story was a pleasure to read. 4 stars~Complimentary copy received in exchange for a honest review.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Daniel's Decision by Nicole Flockton", "unixReviewTime": 1402790400, "reviewTime": "06 15, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "AWYK9GKJZFEQ8", "asin": "B00JX12K3W", "reviewerName": "P.

I enjoyed this story immensely and loved watching brooding Daniel Whitman become instantly smitten with Rochelle Harris upon meeting her. I so enjoy when the hero has to &#34;eat his words&#34; since he insistently informed his younger brother that he was not in the market for a relationship and that he would not fall in love any time soon. Poor Daniel is surrounded by happy couples and the one that's especially hard for him to deal with is his father's newfound happiness after his mother's death. The author did a great job portraying the closeness that Daniel and his mom shared and the deep loss he still feels every time he thinks about her. It was deeply touching and it broke my heart as he recalled their special moments together and nearly had me in tears. I love when I can connect with a character in a story and can actually feel his or her pain.Daniel is also struggling to convince his dad of his new business proposal for the family's resort and it does not help his demeanor when it's rejected. He travels to visit an Australian resort successfully managed by Rochelle to learn more and get ideas for his own resort in the US. Rochelle is extremely wary of her growing feelings for Daniel and hesitant to act on them due to being deceived in the past. I liked that the heroine was portrayed as an intelligent, successful woman who was able to rise above the hardship and painful past. It was great to see these two express their feelings with each other about their parents and their mutual love of operating a resort. I also enjoyed the unexpected twist and turns as they must overcome a misunderstanding and let trust shine through. I really liked them together and their love scenes were sexy, sweet and romantic.

He&#8217;d never had to work to get a girl in bed and he always made it clear it wasn&#8217;t going to be a serious thing. But from the moment Sophia hit him with her volleyball, Jake became a tongue-tied, stumbling idiot for the girl he just had to have. Sophia had heard of Brandon&#8217;s reputation though, and as the confident, self-assured woman that she was, she made Brandon work for it. When they finally got together, it was fireworks and magic, passion and fire.Life has a way of calming down even the hottest of flames over time and the once passion-filled romance eventually turned into a comfortable marriage with two daughters. Brandon was focused on his career and Sophia was a supportive wife and mother handling everything at home. Then one day she walked in on something that never should have happened and her entire world crumbled to the ground.The story is told in two parts: the past and the present. In the past, the reader gets to experience firsthand just how magical the romance between Brandon and Sophia could be. In the present, Sophia&#8217;s sister convinces her to go on a trip to figure out how she wants to move forward and more importantly, to rediscover the confident, adventurous woman she&#8217;d once been. I could identify with Sophia in every way: from the way she handled her life-changing crisis to the way she struggled over how to move forward. And Brandon, I loved reading about just how much he adored Sophia; it was evident in most everything he did and it made their crossroads that much more painful. What I loved most about WRECKING BALL was the way Ms. Toler created two characters that you could completely empathize with and fall in love with, which made their split hit that much closer to home.WRECKING BALL is sad, steamy, romantic, and fun all combined into one fantastic novel.

However, Tyler&#8217;s strength is that she&#8217;s able to breathe new life into the well-worn tale.She draws in the reader by cleverly re-imagining such historic figures as Anne Boleyn (rechristened Annette Hevers) and Catherine Howard (Keira Howard) as women of today. Tyler presents them with warmth and empathy&#8212;refusing to resort to their easily clich&eacute;d depictions&#8212;but never shying away from their tragic failings.She even manages to find a sprinkling of sympathy for the brilliant but tortured Harry, a king among men, even if only in his own musings.&#8220;Kings and Queens&#8221; is the perfect read for anyone captured by the drama of almost 500 years past, as well as those who simply appreciate the battles that can rage in ones&#8217; own heart.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The girls are just wild about Harry", "unixReviewTime": 1406073600, "reviewTime": "07 23, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A7Z7BRHTXJL0P", "asin": "B00JX5ZZ6C", "reviewerName": "CTK", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "What I liked about this one is unlike other gluten free recipe books, you can make these recipes without having to buy some weird exotic brand of gluten free flour for all of the recipes.

Benny fuels Frankie&#8217;s desire with blinding hot sex, he had me swooning and gushing with all his sexy dirty talk and dominating ways.

The family dynamics, the bonds of affection shared between parents, children, and friends were all too familiar. This family mirrored my own. From holiday gatherings to Sunday dinners, KA&#8217;s depiction of the Italian &#8211; American lifestyle was remarkably beautiful. Theresa, the matriarch who is the glue that holds them all together. Vinnie Senior, a man who guides his children and loves them despite their faults &#8211; a man of virtue and honor. My feelings for them were so strong, as they embodied characteristics of my own parents. Needless to say, this story ran the gamut of deep emotions for me.And of course there&#8217;s the food. KA has the gift of making me extremely hungry and horny all at the same time. She has the knack of evoking some pretty powerful urges ;)The Promise was a magnificently written, moving love story that left me blissfully happy. Discovering new characters, visiting some old friends and an attention grabbing storyline made it a fantastic experience that I never wanted to end. I hope you enjoy The Promise as much as I have. Another great heart warming, arousing romance from the amazing Kristen Ashley.

I recently learned more about the Bollinger Bands and knowing that S&R can be used along side of it, SMA's and Fractals made me even more elated! I like that one can utilize many options of trading and investing and spread them out over many different options. Utilizing S&R gives you the same flexibility. I have been looking at adding the Bollinger Band strategy to my arsenal of options, taking S&R and adding it to the other options I am interested in is also amazing. Instead of placing a stop loss to early and yes, you can gain a few extra dollars if it rises a bit, but going up higher (if you have the funds and ability to loose it) assist in extra profits. Patience and discipline is very important in trading. Not to get emotion in trading is important as well. Therefore, observe initially before you get involved, utilizing S&R, with a spread of other options. Apply your breaking and stopping points near the ceiling and floor instead of in the middle and have patience. Then collect even more than you expect.

Unfortunatley in this volume, he comes off as a weak and naive man, which is very different than the smart, strong, intellgent Dmitry that we are all so used to. In fact, this felt more like an ode to the madness of Ivan, than to the strength of Dmitry. Perhaps that was this author's intention, and if it was, kudos. Once again, Ivan gets away with the most despicable things, right under Dmitry's nose. But it wasn't just Ivan, it was Elsa also. I suppose no one is perfect and this could be the set up for Dmitry to fully become the Boss that we all know he really is.

Well, that's all kind of true, but Cynthia being sold is only the focus of the very beginning of the book. And she certainly doesn't gain anything from that decision - at least not directly. Most of the book is actually about how Cynthia is a woman who is actually able to perform magic (something that their society has always insisted is impossible) and how she goes about proving to herself and the world that women are just as capable and worthy of magic as men are.What I loved:The worldbuilding.Once again, Falor does an excellent job of portraying a miserable society in which women are considered nothing more than property (or breeders). We also got to learn more about the people who are fighting to change that!Cynthia.I really enjoyed Cynthia as a main character. In fact, I think I enjoyed her point of view the most out of this series so far. Cynthia has spent her life pretending - pretending to be a sweet, brainless girl who wants nothing more than a handsome warlock to take care of her, while she's really secretly been suffocating. Her one joy has been learning magic. I thought that Cynthia had a realistic mixture of strength and self-doubt. She really wanted to do what was best for her family and for herself, but she didn't always know what that was. I loved that she wanted to be a role model for her little sisters and show them everything that they could be.Lukas.I loved Lukas, the gentle stranger who comes into Cynthia's life and helps her to come into her own. He was Cynthia's protector, but he also encouraged her to be brave herself and to not let go of the ideals she was fighting for. As Lukas and Cynthia grew closer and sparks started to fly between them, I found myself loving their romance!The magic.We really got to see more of the magic of this world in this book, which I was so excited about! Not only did we see the hexes and the defensive spells, but we also got to see a fun and beautiful side to the women's magic. There was plenty of magical action in this book as well!If you're a fan of YA fantasy, you should definitely check out this series!

In the prequel to the series, Mine To Tarnish, Katherine refuses to be owned and finds herself among the tarnished. In book one, You Are Mine, Serena realizes what it means to be free and finds freedom within her grasp. In Mine To Spell, Cynthia (Serena&#8217;s sister) has reached the age in which society dictates she be sold to a new owner &#8211; one who will only value her for the magic contained in her blood.Everyone in Chardonia knows that only male warlocks can do magic and the magic in women only exist to be taken by men to increase their own powers. But everyone is wrong and Cynthia refuses to let her magic be taken. She sets out to prove that women are not merely possessions and that they are as capable as any man &#8211; even if she has to become a martyr to do so.A budding female equality movement set in a background of magic and romance makes me really love the Mine series more and more with each book. I love to cheer on each female protagonist as they pave new roads in the quest for recognition as people and not things. I also really like that romance and independence are not pitted against each other. Cynthia could find love and be her own person at the same time; loving a man didn&#8217;t make her any less of a strong, independent woman. Another trait of hers that didn&#8217;t make her any less in my eyes was her insecurity. That Cynthia was insecure, scared, and unsure as she set out to change history, and yet still refused to back down made her someone to be admired even more. She knew that she wasn&#8217;t just doing this for herself; she was setting a precedent for females all over Chardonia.I love this series and I can&#8217;t recommend it highly enough.

Grant", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "My CommentsI&#8217;m finally able to review the conclusion to this AMAZING series, Knight has quickly become one of my FAVE YA authors as her writing just transports me into these pages and I forget everything else around me!!  The first three chapters are INTENSE, but definitely stay true to the story and just when you think you know how the plot would progress, it all changes again&#8230;.. so if you think you know how things will transpire in Balance after this incredible journey with Semara (I certainly did), you would be very, VERY wrong.  However, that only shows Knight can be true to the story AND brilliant with plot twists.  This story is not for the faint of heart (which I consider myself to be), but it IS worthwhile to courageously follow Semara and her friends as they finally win this ongoing battle.  The Rebels are coming for you, Mandesa, your time is up!Like I mentioned, the first three chapters take off just as Pendulum ended so there is no gap in time as Balance begins.  I cried a little at the sadness of this beginning, some soldiers die here, and the battle rages on.  Nothing graphic is described, but it&#8217;s tangible as Semara fights back with her fellow rebels.One of my favorite scenes happens in the beginning, the Arc leaves the ocean and goes airborne!!  In my mind, it happens in slow motion&#8230;..gradually the submarine leaves the depths of water with the awesome Raeth navigating this change!  The propeller, the engine mechanics, and all other underwater functions cease as this change occurs and as the vessel goes into the air the water and debris melt off giving it the momentum it needs to go forward.  The view changes to go in front of the ship as it travels upward and we see it pass by in the air as it engages into warfare, avoiding the blue mist/buildings/other obstacles and starts heavy fire to help Freedom escape unscathed!  This scene is over in a few seconds, but I loved it and this is what I envisioned :)Everything changes for the Triune in this book and the plot slows down while they recover.  There is less romance in this story, but I considered that a good thing because Balance is more about Semara&#8217;s relationship with Harrison than anyone else.  As much as I enjoy the romance, a girl needs her dad and this book shows their relationship improve beautifully.In the first part of the story, Ryder gets traumatized because of something he experiences and his connection with Semara literally gets put on hold.  Even though I sympathized with the guy and still believe he&#8217;s perfectly suited for her, he REALLY doesn&#8217;t get her in the first half of the book and that was a small disappointment.  There&#8217;s a huge misunderstanding between them as they both must work to overcome new issues, but I kept wondering when they would get a break as a couple.  There are also a few brief sensual scenes with them and I find myself wishing that there was a middle ground for them.  Nothing inappropriate happens, but Semara misses his touch desperately.  Just as he recuperates and things improve, he tries to win her heart once more, but will he be too late?  I do believe that Ryder makes up to Semara whatever distance settled between them, but it slows the story down.  *Come on Ryder, get it together now!!*Semara gets another huge revelation in this book, but the moment she finds out I felt like screaming at her&#8230;.&#8221;STOP asking questions when you know it&#8217;s bad news!&#8221;  It&#8217;s in the past, but it throws another twist into the plot that I did NOT see coming.  There&#8217;s also a traitor (possibly more than one) among the rebels and they have to be careful until they find out who that is.  Semara does not get to use her powers for much of the book and that changes the dynamics of the story.  Also, Semara turns 18 and this changes everything (good and bad).  The brief moment with the kids was utterly sweet!Dear Semara:Please hear me out because you are such an extraordinary character and you deserve to be at peace with yourself.  You are and NEVER will be NOTHING like Mandesa!!!  After living in her evil custody for a decade (or longer), she did EVERYTHING she could to break you and turn you into her, but she couldn&#8217;t!  You are your father&#8217;s daughter and an amazing leader.  You think that everyone around you is brave and capable, but you missed one very important revelation.  You have GREATNESS within you and you&#8217;re a born leader, YOU CANNOT  FAIL.  Things happen unexpectedly and they definitely go wrong, but that&#8217;s not because of you.  The people who have died for this cause have done so willingly and their memory will be honored long after Mandesa and her tyranny have ceased.  There is evil, injustice, and unfairness in this world, but there are also leaders like yourself who will make whatever sacrifices are necessary to thwart them.  Please don&#8217;t give up hope, you deserve to be happy and free just like your friends.  I have been with you on this journey&#8230;..I have laughed with you, cried with you, and cheered you on through this.  You have inspired me and given me hope.  You have provided refuge and survived the impossible.  I have faith that you will continue to overcome and do the right thing.  I know it&#8217;s difficult figuring out who you are and where you belong with such a confusing and dysfunctional past, but I have always believed you would get it and you don&#8217;t need anyone else to be your strength.  Your instincts and your dreams are more accurate than you realize.  Keep fighting, Semara, hope is not lost and the victory is yours!!  Keep defying the dark, Semara, your readers are with you ALL the way!!My favorite characters in this book were Harrison and Dred.  Their love and support for Semara enhances the plot beautifully!  There is also more of Maggie and that kept me smiling, you just GOTTA love that woman (there&#8217;s one scene when Semara nearly knocks her over in a hug and that&#8217;s EXACTLY how I would&#8217;ve reacted)!!  Something else I loved in Balance is Penton and his &#8220;special&#8221; inventions, wow :)  Can I keep him?  Also LOOOOOVED the children&#8217;s safe place&#8230;..Wow, such a GREAT scene that I would love to learn more about if any part of this series gets extended!!  Raeth made me SOOOOO proud, I was just amazed by her character growth.  She goes from being terrified of assassins and unable to cope in so much of Escapement to bombing assassins in Balance, go Raeth!  She&#8217;s also an incredible pilot, feisty, passionate, totally in love with Penton, and no longer terrified of anything.I want to honor both minor characters and one main character who do not survive Balance.  One of these characters is Lanena, Semara&#8217;s real mom.  Lanena was murdered before the series started, but she has a very loving presence in the story that strengthens Semara in amazing ways.  Even though this is a fictional story, it became personal for me and I loved these characters.  So it&#8217;s my pleasure to honor the fallen for their sacrifice and their allegiance to Semara and the Rebellion.  The one main character was someone that loves Semara and was able to give their life helping her succeed.  I was deeply saddened with this person&#8217;s murder, but they will not be forgotten.Other scenes that stood out to me that were just amazing&#8230;..there&#8217;s a very special celebration in the story that is a &#8220;FINALLY&#8221; moment and just beautifully written, that alone is worth the price of this book!  Also sooooo enjoyed how Harrison communicates with Semara, Ryder, Raeth and Penton with his mind.  That is DEFINITELY a gift that comes in handy several times!  And there&#8217;s a moment where Semara, Raeth, and Penton get inked together (special tattoos); Ryder gets re-inked and it&#8217;s just a very special moment in the book that symbolizes they&#8217;re already a family&#8230;..such a beautifully descriptive moment!The ending of Balance gets kind of wild because it&#8217;s a total showdown with Mandesa, but it&#8217;s so worthwhile.  Another main character gets injured and it&#8217;s slightly gory.  Balance is not my favorite book in the series, but I was very satisfied with its conclusion and I felt that the violence was necessary even though some of it is sad.  It was interesting because Semara has been fighting for so long, she doesn&#8217;t consider what happens next putting a new Council together and restoring the evil Mandesa left behind.  She is finally able to move forward and it was an absolute pleasure to see that part of her life.I&#8217;m relieved to finally see the conclusion to this wonderful series, but I&#8217;m also partly sad it&#8217;s over.  Does anyone ever feel like that when they grow to love the characters and the journey you&#8217;ve been on with them ends?  If I HAD to choose a favorite in this series, it would probably be Escapement, but I connected with the series overall.  Even though each book can be read as a standalone, I highly recommend reading them in order so you can appreciate and follow along accordingly.  I didn&#8217;t give Balance five stars because of certain aspects of the story I didn&#8217;t agree with.  There is some profanity and the sensuality between Ryder and Semara was just unnecessary for my reading taste.  I&#8217;m soooo happy they&#8217;re in love, they connect with one another in profound ways, and they&#8217;re so well suited for one another&#8230;..that&#8217;s soooo great!  However, these brief scenes did not enhance the story for me.  That being said, The Neumarian Chronicles is one of my favorite YA series along with Uglies by Scott Westerfeld, Starters by Lissa Price, and Anomaly/Luminary by Krista McGee!  Semara and her friends are such great characters that are easy to relate to and root for as they overcome bombardment, misunderstandings, war, betrayal, suicide bombers, MORE assassins, treachery, the unknown, seeing innocents being murdered and enslaved, and other traps that come their way.  Yet they discover in Balance that it&#8217;s not JUST about surviving, but also not letting yourself become hardened and allowing yourself to love those around you without fear of losing them.  You have to fight for freedom, but it&#8217;s worth fighting for!!I want to thank the author and author&#8217;s assistant April for the review ecopy of Balance provided (the rest of the series I purchased).  I also want to thank April for answering my questions and discussing the book with me to help me understand and get the closure I needed for this book.  It was such a pleasure reviewing this one!

After Bill loses his lucrative job, suddenly his loving 10 year marriage is in danger of falling apart.  Unable to obtain a new job, in dire financial straits and almost homeless, Bill inherits some land and a house from a long-lost aunt on Mateguas Island.Linda Watkins did a really good job at setting the stage on the relationship between Bill and his wife Karen.  I felt like I was on that ferry with them as they approached the island for the first time.  She also did a good job at highlighting the differences in personalities between the adorable twins, Terri and Sophie.  The characters were well fleshed out and the settings were dynamic.  I booed at Bill for his roving eye and infidelity, but had to applaud him for his actions when he finally Manned UP and did right by his family.  And who wouldn&#8217;t want to have a sexy Dex around just for eye candy.The story starts at a decent pace but got bogged down in the middle.  Too much everyday life interspersed with the ongoing story and trying to solve the mystery of the swamp hag.  I realize drama needs to build, but it went just a tad bit too slow for my taste.  But once all the action started and Karen understood what she needed to do to save her family, the pace went pretty fast.  The parts of the story that stick out in my mind, are when Karen first discovers the magical field / swamp, Karen&#8217;s fight with the owl and Bill&#8217;s confrontation with the swamp hag.  Something I wouldn&#8217;t want to meet on a dark, stormy night, alone, unarmed.Even though I like the story, there were 2 points that niggled at the back of my mind.  One, Karen professes to love her kids and family through the entire story, but part of why they were on the island to begin with was her selfishness in not getting a job after Bill lost his.  Also, swamp land is on bottom land.  Yet the house and property were at the highest point on the island.  There was no description of how the swamp lay in regards to the house.  There was the backyard that led to the woods that led to the swamp.  Was it a hilly wooded area?  Did the backyard slope down to the woods?  Who knows?  Maybe something that could be elaborated on more in the sequel.Overall, if you like dark mysteries and family drama, this is the book for you.

All are rare in society marriages in Regency England, and Jane is truly aware of her fortunate circumstance.  Until, that is, Jacob has a terrible accident that leaves his future in doubt, and his plans in turmoil.If Jacob were to die, the rules of inheritance state that his distasteful brother Arthur would inherit, and Jane and her daughters would be left at his mercy.  With no male child, Jane&#8217;s status would be severely reduced, or endangered should Arthur decide she would marry him.A scandalous and rather unusual solution to the situation comes to Jacob: his cousin Matthew is kind, generous and most importantly willing to help.  His rapport with the couple is much more to both their tastes, but can they manage to produce a male heir before anyone discovers this unusual arrangement?Surprisingly for a novella Viveka Portman manages to define character and voice, and add an emotional component into what could be an incredibly tricky situation.  Both thrilled and appalled at the solution, all three in this triangle are struggling with their own feelings of jealousy, envy and insecurity as the bond between Jane and Matthew grows: none more unsettled by the emotional turmoil than Jacob.  Portman has cleverly given us characters that are risking emotional pain and suffering for the best of intentions, even with deception at the heart of the arrangement.  Fast paced and tightly written, readers will be drawn into the emotions as the story progresses to reveal some very steamy moments on the way to the conclusion.  A quick and steamy read that doesn&#8217;t lose sight of the love and determination of one man to protect what he cherishes most: his family.I received an eArc copy of the title from Harlequin Escape via NetGalley for purpose of honest review.

The magic that each Coven member uses is as elemental as each person is different so the way they fight and the types of spells they use is quite interesting to read.

This is one of my fallback series to read when I don't have any other new books striking my fancy, and that's pretty high praise from me.

Normally tough and self-assured rugby player Hugh Latimer, already nursing an injured arm, is trying his best to balance suddenly having to take care of his much-younger half-siblings with the fact that he now finds himself living next door to a fun, quirky, drop-dead-gorgeous-&-a-half soap opera actress who&#8217;s got problems of her own. You really can&#8217;t help identifying with Hugh, who, on the one hand, is entirely smitten with Josie, and on the other hand, just wants to get back to his comfort zone -- because he&#8217;s pretty up-front about the fact that, in the role of parent, he doesn&#8217;t know what the hell he&#8217;s doing (Who does?). When Hugh and two of his rugby teammates are invited to play a brief scene as themselves on Josie&#8217;s soap opera (set in a hospital), things start to seriously percolate, and&#8230; well, I don&#8217;t wanna give too much away here. But James knows exactly where she&#8217;s going with this, and it&#8217;s a pretty fun ride getting there. Hugh isn&#8217;t perfect, but he&#8217;s a profoundly good guy, and you want him to get together with Josie, who deserves a break in life too, because, even though her life looks pretty sweet from the outside, that just goes to show, the outside is by no means the whole picture. No vampires here, or secret agents, ticking time bombs, critically misdirected telegrams, etc., just a couple of nice, smart people drawn together almost gravitationally by mutual attraction in the modern-day New Zealand setting James has made her romantic playground.

Stand Alone.&#34;You're Pretty. For a fat girl.&#34;Immediately I was able to relate to the heroine in Fat (Labels #1) by Saranna DeWylde . I can't count how many times I've been told what a beautiful face I have (thanks, I know, the rest of me is hideous). Growing up with a gorgeous, skinny mom and two gorgeous skinny sisters don't help things.I enjoy a book with a heavy heroine, though for some reason, I just can't stand a book that is labeled BBW (this isn't). I mean, why does it have to be a genre? Can't it just be a romance with an average heroine? Aah, but I'm getting off track here. Saranna has written a book that she says will make women feel better about themselves. Well no, it didn't do that for me, but it was nice to read about a character I could relate to.I have read other books with curvy heroines that I just couldn't relate to, no matter how good the book was. These were confident women. Women who embraced their curves and wore leather and sparkles. I'm a fat girl who hides. I love fashion, but it looks awful on me (though I still try). I've tried to be a confident woman but I can't. I have eyes.Claire Howard is 5'10&#34; and a size 26. She is a big girl, but apparently she's still pretty damn sexy! Maybe it's the bodacious tatas she has poking out of her clothes. Maybe it's the great line of clothes she is wearing from her website Chubbalicious. Or maybe it's because Kieran, her roommate, is a male stripper. But to me, I think it's because of her outward confidence. I know a few women that size who just come off totally hot to me. Partially because they are, but partially because their confidence makes them that way. Claire is confident on the outside, but inside her body negativity was like reading the post I wrote for Starting on Monday but thought it was too much of a downer to post for weeks.&#34;I had him fooled, I had most of them fooled. There were days I even had myself fooled and I believed everything I said about thinking I was beautiful and sexy at any size.&#34;Claire and Kieran are roommates and best friends. She spend a lot of time at the male strip club he works at and kind of has an extended family with the guys. She has always been attracted to Kieran, but never acted on it. He has a steady stream of woman and she's just fat.&#34;They'd all wonder if I was his sugar mama, if I was paying his bills, or what exactly I had over him that might explain why a guy like him would ever date a woman like me.&#34;But when Kieran suggests she date Brant, a fellow stripper, who has been attracted to her a long time, Claire says no. Why? Because he is 5'6&#34;. Pot, meet kettle. But after she hears Kieran giving her friend a 'birthday gift', Claire decides to give in and go out with Brant. I loved Brant. He was confident (he's a stripper!), sexy (again, he's a stripper!), tender, warm, funny and smart. And dirty...giving Claire a big O in public on their first date. (I have a major Brant crush!)&#34;I'm going to make you come so hard and long you'll beg me to stop.&#34;But when it came right down to it, I was totally able to relate to Claire. I was able to relate so much it made me cry at the same time Claire wanted to cry.&#34;I didn't want to be bare in front of him, my body exposed--all of my fat out there for him to see.&#34;&#34;He still wanted me. But I didn't want myself. So I didn't understand how he could want me.&#34;But when Kieran realizes that Brant is with the woman he's wanted...he joins in.Though I'm focusing on the sexy stuff, this isn't really an erotica book, nor is it a romance, though it has elements of both. There isn't a run off into the sunset happy ending. It was a book about labels. And living and loving your life despite them. Claire is fat, Kieran is gorgeous, Brant is short, Bex is a slut. We all have labels to overcome.Likes:&#8226;I was so able to relate to the heroine! Though I'm not as big, every drop of negative self talk has been in my head on a loop for the past 20 years.&#8226;Hot sex.&#8226;Menage with two male strippers, no complaints.&#8226;I liked all of the side characters.Dislikes:&#8226;I found it a little depressing, despite the fact that the fat girl got two gorgeous strippers.&#8226;All of the negative self-talk got a bit too repetitive after a while (though it never shuts off in my own head).&#8226;The book was about learning to love one's self and becoming comfortable in your own skin. Well hello? If I had two gorgeous male strippers who wanted me I think I would be able to feel a whole lot better about myself too!&#8226;What exactly is Chubbalicious? Who is the designer? At first I thought she designed the clothes. There wasn't enough elaboration on the business that was such a great part of the book. So little in fact, that when it launched, what happened made no sense at all.Rating: 3.5-3.75 stars, 4.5 heat.Fat by Saranna DeWylde is a very different book. Since it is more about a woman's journey to overcome her own labels than a romance, it left me a bit melancholy. The heroine was so relatable it was like reading my own thoughts on paper. There was a very strong message in the story, and it's almost too bad that the author felt the need to push it so much with male strippers. Maybe if the guys were a little more average I would have bought the whole thing. Maybe it would have more easily convinced me to join her in her journey to love herself. Send those two strippers here and I'll start feeling good about myself too! The book was well written though, and I think I would enjoy reading the author's other books.See more at http://anasattic.com/", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A woman's journey to overcome her own labels", "unixReviewTime": 1405123200, "reviewTime": "07 12, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A3VVPK7D7X0QK7", "asin": "B00K23BQEO", "reviewerName": "H.C.

And we all are our own worst critic.I have been the &#34;fat girl&#34;. People used to say hurtful things and just like Claire, I learned to push them down and pretend that I was unaffected. I have lost weight but I still see the fat girl in the mirror if I don't focus on the positives.Reading Claire's story struck a chord in me. I felt like I was reading my own story and also reading my new best friend's story. I wanted to be there to give her a hug when she was upset and I wanted to smack the people who hurt her casually. I was thrilled that she examined her life and made some changes as well as letting go of her negative inner voice.I will admit that at first I was a little angry with her roomate Kiernan but then I realized that he has issues and self esteem problems too. and then, mostly I felt pity for him.Actually many of the characters in this story struggle with labels. It doesn't matter if they are male or female, fat or thin, beautiful or plain.

That's what kept going through my head as I read this book!  I didn't like her in Break Me, so I hurt for Court/Pierce, but man I was done with her!  So to read a book from his POV where he is healing and moving on with another wonderful, spunky, sassy, appreciative young lady was just refreshing!Attached to Annabella from the age of seven, Courtney Pierce is willing to change everything about himself to keep her love and to protect her from the world.  The only ones he can't protect is everyone from her, including himself.  Broken, alone, and disgusted with himself Court is shocked when Rachel Sanders, his longtime enemies&#8217; twin shows up at his door seeking comfort. Not knowing that one night of comfort might turn into so much more and that Annabella might come back to ruin it all, Court takes comfort where he can find it.  Sometimes two broken hearts are the best medicine, but then again sometimes they just continue to break.I really enjoyed reading this continuation of the Make or Break series!  Catching up with Wesley and Royal, Paisley and Channing, and waiting on Ashley and Victor to work things out has been a great world to live in once again!

Ford and Mia are very different, but together they are perfect for each other.Ford is gruff, proud, lonely, he made a serious motorbike accident and the damage still gives him big problems in walking because of the pain, but he tries to hide his disability to others because he doesn't want to receive pity from anyone. He prefers to stay away from the famous party of the O'Kane and he works body and soul, helping to increase Dallas' business.Mia comes from Sector Two, where the girls are trained to be the perfect lovers, prostitutes of high board , and become the property of men that buy them.

Sometimes Jamila hated her mother, she knew that was such a strong word but at times that's how she truly felt. She treated her child like trash & treated her man like a king. She blamed all her problems. Symone blamed all her problems on others never once taking responsibility for her own actions as a grown woman. She couldn't fathom the thought of seeing anyone else happy. Even worst, she was jealous of her own daughter. She was still hurting from her father's death & took her anger out on her family. Every child deserved a childhood with them just being a carefree kid. It was sad to see a child lose faith in God because of the actions of someone grown. Glad Jamila learned that she shouldn't worry about if people liked her or not. She wasn't their to impress people but people were there to impress her. I liked how even though Jason missed the first few years of Jamila's life he was still the father she needed. I loved Uncle Mikel, Jamila's well being was always his main priority. The kids in your stories are always funny. I know Granny Delilah didn't want to see her daughter behind bars but sometimes the decisions that have to be made May be the hardest thing another person would ever have to make. Jamila needed to forgive the people who had wronged her so she wouldn't have to be burdened with that load on her conscious. Walking around with so much hate on you will do nothing but hold you back.  Jamila had an amazing woman in her life to show her that forgiveness is one of the keys to happiness. & even though mama didn't raise her, she bad a supportive, loving & caring family that did.

Uyeh was more than I expected, beginning in a country I've never visited before in a novel, Nigeria, and taking turns in the plot that should give fans of romantic suspense a lot to chew on. One twist/turn was a bit too far-fetched for me to completely buy into, personally, but it was a creative idea that brought the story together. I liked getting into Rodrigo's head from the beginning of his romance with Jennifer, to see what else was behind his smile besides desire. I also liked how Jennifer wasn't the only one with a hard, private plight to face in this relationship, and truth be told, I personally found Rodrigo's side of things to be the more interesting of the two.It wasn't long before Rodrigo &#34;won her heart,&#34; but it didn't appear to me that it took much beyond his looks and physical advances to make Jennifer's heart open and available to him. I found a deeper and more convincing explanation about why he might love her than why she'd love him, especially so quickly. After a while, though, I went with it.I've seen the issue of Christians marrying people outside of the Christian faith addressed before in fiction, and I applaud the author for boldly addressing it in this novel. Since this theme coursed throughout the book, one thing I would have liked to see delved into more thoroughly is: why? If Jennifer was going against her values and beliefs by getting romantically involved with Rodrigo, what were those beliefs, specifically, beyond the &#34;cardinal rule&#34; that was applied to mean &#34;don't get married to someone who isn't of this religion&#34;? If Rodrigo had just been a nice guy Jennifer met without the shocking truth that would shake their world (as the book blurb describes), what principles would have made the rule she believed in important, beyond the surface &#34;do's and don't's&#34;, when it simply came to Rodrigo, the human being? However, it's just a question, one that would likely be beside the point of this story.As I'm a reader who loves stories of hope, I found the message of hope in this novel to be a big plus. &#34;No matter how dead something may look, if you never give up on it, you just might give it a chance to live again.&#34; Yes!____________I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "More than a Romance", "unixReviewTime": 1403308800, "reviewTime": "06 21, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "AL9083X9N001J", "asin": "B00K2GAUC0", "reviewerName": "Angela Lawson", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "This book is written with some sass from Dylan and Joey' s good times at the bakery to Dylan and Reese falling for each other.

I couldn't wait for Trent's story and I have to say that Micalea Smeltzer did such an amazing job with this story.  I felt all of the emotions that Trent and Rowan felt. It was an emotional roller coaster ride and you may want to have a few tissues handy.Rowan is just 21 years old but she has had more responsibilities than most girls her age. Her mother is a drunk, her step father is a sleezeball,  and her real father left when she was little. Her mother is both verbally and physically abusive to her and basically tells her how worthless she is, when in reality it is just the opposite.  At 21 years of age Rowan should be worrying about her friends, her classes, boys, what she will be doing on her weekends, the normal stuff that most college aged girls worry about.  But life for Rowan is not the norm. She has been taking care of her brother and sister for as long as she can remember.  She works hard, goes to school and is more of a mother to those two kids than her mother ever was.  Rowan deserves happiness and love in her life, but the meaning of love to Rowan has been scarred because of her childhood.  There is one person in her past that has always been there for her.  One person who understood her and loved her.  But she pushed him away the minute he expressed his true feelings.  And now five years later he wants her back.Trent Wentworth grew up in a very privileged household.  Never wanting for anything.  He is one of the sweetest, caring young men out there.  He has loved Rowan since they were 16 and never cared what her family life was like. But for Rowan, Trent is so far out of her league that she feels she doesn't deserve him and pushes him away. But Trent knows and feels what is between them.  And he will do what it takes to make her his.  But Rowan has a secret from her past.  And once that secret comes out it could ruin any chance that they have together.Trent was just amazing.  His caring and thoughtful ways will completely melt you heart.  If you loved Trace in the first books then would will fall in love with his brother. My heart broke for Rowan for what she went through.  But she is one strong woman who will do what it takes to make sure her siblings are cared for, loved and have a good life. But despite her strength when it comes to those two kids, she has her own insecurities, not feeling that she deserves the love that Trent has for her.  As much as she wants to be with him she knows that he deserves better.Tempting Rowan was a fantastic read. When Rowan's secret comes out I was so afraid of what would happen next. I loved them together and knowing this secret could destroy their love just made my heart ache for them.  And if that heartache wasn't enough there was this &#34;holy crap&#34; moment where I found myself with tears in my eyes praying that it would all be ok.  It's was an emotional story, between the moments that followed the big secret reveal, to the way Rowan's mother treated her to her own insecurities about how worthless she felt at times.  But it also had those moments that will melt your heart.  I loved every minute of it.  Ms. Smeltzer knows how to draw you in.  She knows how to make you feel the pain and the emotion of her characters.  I think she completely outdid herself with this one. I honestly didn't see the twists coming and when they did I was afraid of where it was heading.  What I also loved was that we also got an added bonus in the form for Trace and Olivia.  I especially loved the moments towards the end with Trace and how amazing and understanding he was.  Excellent job.

I am so in love with Rowan & Trent. This book literally lad me laughing one minute. Then, I'm crying or I have my hand over my mouth in shock. This book had 1st love & then 1st heartbreak. It had a little bit of everything in it. And, I for one. Loved every single thing about 'Tempting Rowan'.Rowan is completely closed off. She has a mother who hates her. Is always so drunk she's never awake. And, when she is awake she's very unpleasant. Her step-dad has a very serious hand problem. Every time he was around I cringed. Rowan feels broken & empty inside. Unable to be loved. She feels unworthy. Then why stay around? Rowan stays around to take care of her little brother & sister. Who every time they were around you'll have a smile on your face. Rowan vows to graduate college, get a good job, make enough money and take them and run. So, until that happens she keeps everyone at arms length. Including her 2 best friends Tatum & Jude.Then, Trent comes home from school & throws a wrench in her plans! If you read 'Finding Olivia & Chasing Olivia' then you know how perfect Trace is. Well, Trenton Wentworth is just as perfect as his older brother! He has been in love with Rowan since they were 16. The night they lost their virginity to each other he let her know how he felt. Rowan on the other hand ran & never looked back. Now, Trenton is back and is going to do anything & everything to get her back!!Every time Rowan turns around there is Trent. He follows her to the food stores, the library where she works. It's driving her insane. Because, when she goes home he invades her mind, her dreams. It's killing her because he is the only person who has ever had her heart. The only person she'd give it too. But, deep down Rowan knows he'll never except everything she has to offer.Over time Trent finally gets Rowan to agree to go on a date with him. Trent breaks her down and gets Rowan to see that it's OK for her to live. For her to do stuff for herself. Rowan is definitely enjoying her time with Trent. He's there for her when she needs it. I was stoked to see Trace & Olivia there as well.Then, Rowan's secret comes out. I literally dropped my kindle. It's a big wow moment!! She has some explaining to do. Trent & Rowan must figure out whats next. Even if there is a next.There's so much going on in this book!! I literally felt for Rowan.There hasn't been a character in awhile that has affected me the way she did. She's such a beautiful, strong woman. Yet, she can't seem to see that. Jude & Tatum (who you'll love) have known her for awhile and even they don't know all her deep dark secrets. I can't stand her mom & step-dad with a passion!!!!

That is a testament to the skill and artistry of the Holy Ghost Writer, whoever he or she is. The premise is that Sherlock Holmes is narrating to Watson the story of the adventures of Huck Finn as told to him by Finn himself when he attended Yale no less!  The story is light hearted and funny, and it is so rich in its descriptions the reader is able to sink into the pages and experience the adventure right along with Huck.  The sidebar of the interaction between Holmes and Watson and the added spice of learning what happens to Huck as he becomes a man is a great tale in and of itself.  This is the first I've heard of the Holy Ghost Writer, but won't be my last purchase of one of these books.  The author is an excellent writer and the story grabs you and won't let go until you've read it all.  Finally, on top of the entertaining narrative, the identity of the author is not only an intriguing mystery, but solving the riddle can make you some money!  What's not to love!

But while Ally and Maddie, Ronald&#8217;s twin sister, are shopping for a dress for Ally to wear to dinner with Ron and his parents, her world falls apart.

Greg Stanton being an ER doctor on the verge of burning out, and Carrie Jankowski as the manager of New Beginnings Assisted Living Facility tend to only run into each other at the gravest of times. Greg for the most part is the Doctor with the responsibility of telling Carrie that another senior in her care has passed on. Their attraction for each other is strong, but the circumstances in which they generally meet up aren&#8217;t really conducive to taking things to the next level.The woman he met far too frequently in the worst possible circumstances.Greg and Carrie are both strong independent characters and I liked that, both are battling a few demons, but not in an overly angsty way. Carrie helping Greg at his lowest point is what prompts him to seek her out and take the next step, after deciding to take some time away from the hospital he makes her the offer of a week of no-strings casual fun, that they both think they been looking for...Sex. Lust. Desire. No strings attached.If you are stuck for what to read next, and are looking for an enjoyable filler while you make up your mind then Healing her Heart is a perfect novella to do that.

While his views of women sometimes seems a little off, it really helped make him just a little too overprotective, but in the best possible way.Aly was the traditional pretty and intelligent girl that didn't trust in her own beauty. But this time there was a very good reason why. And her reason why tied into so many other things in the story so beautifully that the whole back story was about as seamless as you could get. I loved how she kept running off and driving Arif al Najimi crazy trying to keep an eye on her.Watching Aly and Arif al Najimi hunt for turtle nests and try to find out why they were dying off was a great story. There was a lot more action than what seems possible in a turtle nest hunt. There were even several times I found myself getting excited right along with them at a new next found.

Maybe she is a friend of a friend? Really, I haven&#8216;t a clue how I found her. Anyway, she has been heavily promoting her new book and seems to think it totally rocks. As she seems normal enough, and I was very intrigued by the title - what does that even mean?? - I decided to give it a try.Overall, it is a pretty good book. Ryder the ass-kicking forensic accountant, and Devin  the rich boy turned MMA fighter turned department store executive, make a great couple.  Having them hook up for a single night before the story even begins is a nice set-up for a love conflict, and not one usually employed. The crime-solving aspect, the fashion world setting, the traveling to an exotic locale all make for a fun read. It&#8217;s a simple, fluffy romance, masquerading as an action novel. Oh, and there is loads of sexual chemistry, and some very hot sex.The forward story is written fairly well. The backstory, however, is not. The book reads as if the author just plugged information into dialogue to bring the reader up to speed. The first conversation in the entire book is one in which the two characters present announce the age of the other person. &#8220;You&#8217;re too cynical for a 25 year old,&#8221; he says, and she responds by also listing a quality of his and stating his age. Who speaks like that?Later in chapter one, Ryder has a conversation with her brother in which they both repeatedly state their relationship. I am positive that both little sister Ryder and big brother Tony are well aware they are siblings and do not require reiteration of this point in conversation. Repeatedly.The worst example of this telling through unnecessary dialogue is with Ryder and her friends, at a coffee shop. The scene involves only her two besties and her, yet when they get on the topic of Ryder&#8217;s last Terrible Boyfriend, the two friends give a detailed account of what was bad about the relationship and what ultimately ended it. As if they are telling this to someone unfamiliar with the story instead of to Ryder herself. What is most puzzling about this exchange is how thoroughly unnecessary it is. A few chapters later the story of Ryder and her crappy ex is revealed in a smoother and more appropriate manner. Why then bother with the strange coffee shop conversation?The main story is written pretty well so why the author used such a clunky method to fill in these blanks is beyond me. I think she can do better.I also think she needs a new proofreader, because it is &#8220;guerilla&#8221; warrior, not &#8220;gorilla&#8221; warrior. Right in the middle of a serious scene, the precursor to the climactic battle, and I get an image of two apes bashing each other. Which is not at all what actually happens in the final battle scene, btw. I thought the mistake was funny, and then (regretfully) wondered what gorilla warfare would actually entail. It is much more gruesome and disturbing than I expected.Avery Flynn shows promise as a writer, and I am hoping she steps up her game in the future.

When Jeremy Jameson or JJ met Reg Moore in a back street bar he didn't in his wildest dreams think he would find a best  friend never mind the love of his life! JJ comes from a family of celebrities and a life of fame and fortune, but no love. Reg is almost the opposite and he strives to show JJ how important love and friendship is. JJ takes Reg on tour with him and Reg slowly shows JJ how good love is. JJ never thought he was gay until he eventually fell in love with Reg. Their love is passionate but very sweet at the same time. I love how a simple touch of the hand from Reg can instantly calm JJ down. Reg is very touchy feely with JJ and it turns out that this is just what JJ wants and needs. They have a lot to overcome from the paparazzi to insiders trying to sell sex tapes, but they do it together. Reg is strong for JJ and the two balance each other. I have to say that these two softies just made me want to go annah! They really are just perfect together. If you want a beautiful love story with some hot sex and a rock star then this book is perfect. It really does deserve to be read.

What a way to begin her journey into the writing world, this book is beyond erotic and addictive.Clara is an American living in England; she has graduated with her degree from Oxford University and is ready to start her career. Life is predictable and boring until the night of her graduation reception lands in her in the presence of a mysterious stranger. In his arms under the spell of his magical lips, that is. Left swooning and more than a little confused by the encounter that has left her with an unsatisfied ache, Imagine Clara&#8217;s surprise when she finds herself on the cover of a tabloid the following day in the arms of her mysterious and magical mouthed stranger&#8230;the Prince of England&#8230;The characters for king and country are sharp, quick witted and just plain fun to spend time with. Even the ones you will learn to despise and there are more than a few, just so you know. Clara has secrets from her past that she is trying to move on from and leave in the past and well Alexander is a member of the royal family, so his closet has more dirty laundry than a Laundromat. This does nothing to dampen their attraction for one another. It seems to fuel it, even. The sneaking around, the thrill of being caught only fuels the inferno that rages between them. Clara and Alexander have both agreed that this relationship is a physical one only; feelings will not enter into the equation. We can all see where this plan is dubiously flawed am I right?&#8220;Alexander intoxicated me. Without his touch, I forgot how to breathe. He had become the center of gravity I returned to after being stretched past my limits.&#8221;Alexander is dominant, secretive, seductive and relentless in the pursuit of what he desires and he desires Clara. Clara is intelligent, sassy, and jaded from a previous relationship. She is independent, unattached. She is powerless to resist the draw Alexander has on her body, against her own better judgement. This man that reduces her to a proverbial puddle no matter how she tries.&#8220;If you run, Clara. I will follow you.&#8221;Beyond erotic, For King and Country is a sublime debut.

Acting as chaperone to Serena, at a country house party being held by the Marquis Lyndham and his mother to find him an appropriate wife from the many potential young brides available in the new Season, she hadn&#8217;t any intention of finding a lover there but then again, one must never say never.Seth Rowland the Marquis Lyndham understands he has a duty to his family, and has agreed to find himself a proper wife. Things change when Lady Isabel Avenbury enters his home with her young sister. Isabel catches his attention more than any other woman does in attendance. Even before Isabel married, Seth had noticed her and now she was here, in his home, looking as beautiful and desirable as ever, plus she was a widow. Everything told him his mother, and society would never approve of her as a wife but unable to keep himself from her, he was willing to settle for being her lover &#8211; or so he thought.The Ladies&#8217; Book of Pleasures series by Jess Michaels centers around the naughty inspirations brought on by a book, which appears to have been written by a Lady of the ton - a book giving advice to the young Ladies of the ton on how best to give pleasure to their men as well as gain pleasure for themselves. A MATTER OF SIN, book one in the Ladies&#8217; Book of Pleasures series is an enticing beginning to what I hope will continue to be an intriguing, fun, sexy, and eventually mystery solving series.

I highly recommend this series starter if you love a country party filled with gossipy women, interfering friends and family, and sexy midnight trysts.

It had less of the darkness of the first two and wrapped up a lot of the storyline, while opening up a whole new avenue for the characters. I would not go into this if you haven't read the first two as it really is a continuation of the story.While Trace and Micah are the focus, Gabe, Dare, Kyle and Ben are very much involved. Although their secrets have previously come out, the effects are still rippling through the group and there may still be someone looking to hurt them. We now find out that Trace has a secret past that is threatening the business he has built and could potentially bring harm to the friends he considers his family. Trace finds the greatest comfort in his collared sub and lover Micah. Into the middle of all this worry, Trace's former lover Gray is paying a visit under the guise of an inspection of Diadem by the Master's Circle, but they too have unfinished business.Micah is also struggling to overcome his own personal losses. He has had an open marriage with Iliana and although she is aware of and involved with Trace, she is unaware of the extent of Trace and Micah's relationship. Although they had problems long before Trace entered the picture, Micah still loves her and does not want to end the relationship.This book begins an integration of the world created by Jack L. Pyke in the Don't...series as Trace was trained by the Master's Circle. I think the introduction of Gray, Jack and Jan into this story was well done and fans of that series would benefit greatly from reading this book. Also, if you have read Ms. Kelling's Whatever The Cost, you will be familiar with The Company, another one of Trace's past employers and just why Trace has good reason to be so scared. Enough background is given, however, so it is not necessary to have read these books.Lynn Kelling infuses plenty of emotion into the story, as well as a lot of hot and heavy BDSM. The interplay between the three couples continues to be quite complicated as lines between friends, Doms, subs and lovers continue to blur.

They both have alot of things going on in their life and that to me felt real. I also thought that I had the story down and then things happened that I didnt see coming.

Autumn is such a sweet girl and I just love how she is there for him no matter what. There is a time or two where she is not able to handle it but with persuasion it all unfolds really well.

I think it's quite obvious from the title and the blurb that something happened and these two characters are dealing with the fallout. Mitch thought Paige deliberately trapped him thus compromising his future. What follows is some of the best I've read in a while. I hated Mitch but at the same time I felt that because his background it's easy to see why he would feel that way. He is flawed, flawed, flawed. I wanted to junk-punch him. I wanted to shake him and knock some sense into him.Paige was a likable heroine, which was a pleasant surprise. NA heroines are often unlikable and whiny to me but Paige wasn't. She made a mistake, a lie of omission but she was never cruel nor manipulative. I loved how she stood up for herself. But they were both young and made a mistake that affected their future.

The sense of realism and despair that pervades this novella makes you root for both Skylina and Ryder in the hope that life for these two will just get better.Skylina's essentially sold to the highest bidder by her own mother; an idea so awful you wish it weren't happening to thousands of young women (and men) everyday. But happen it does. What she's faced since she was a child would be enough to make a normal person feel like puking. She's been involved with perverts and sickos as a teen, graduating to erotic dancing and turning tricks in adulthood.Ryder was a spoiled-brat rich kid with a talent for dancing that he lost just when he thought he could make it big. Pain and grief made him an addict, more to escape the reality of losing his dreams that to just cope with his physical difficulties. His parents have finally decided that tough love is in order and Ryder will just have to shape up or find himself on the street.I've often wondered how sex slaves (in my opinion, prostitution is akin to slavery) feel when faced with a &#34;client&#34; that is physically abhorrent, horribly unhygienic, or abusive. I found an echo of my imaginings in Skylina's nauseous, despairing thoughts as she performed her services. Not a surprise that she has low self esteem to match.Ryder's drug crutch may be unbelievable to some, but I have had a Ryder of my own in my life. After an accident destroyed a young man's budding art career, the morphine that was supposed to take away his pain started him on experiments with other drugs that would give him a &#34;better&#34; high while being less addictive, according to him. Rehab always failed and the addiction ended in his death less than a year ago. There is so much truth in Ryder's suffering that it sparked happy and painful memories more than once.If there is a constant in life, it is hope. Second chances exist, but taking them depends solely on the person involved. Ryder wisely took his way out, Skylina isn't so sure about hers. These have nothing to do with their relationship, though, despite the instant attraction they have. Are they simply making each other a new form of addiction or escape? Or will the desire for each other help them to get stronger?This is a beautiful story, so why did I just hand it 4 stars? It gives me that &#34;Flashdance&#34; vibe, with a beautiful young woman doing a stint as an exotic dancer while being coached by a former ballerina to get into a formal dance job. While this is simply a backstory to the main, it did bother me, down to the necklace given to the girl as a gift. Slightly too much of the inspiration. There seemed to be an echo of White Knights in there, too.However, Ryder outshines everything else. He brings the whole tale, since it is more about him healing and helping Skylina along the way. He's a fantastic, strong man and I'm glad his family didn't give up on him, practically pushed him to recover and reach farther than he ever thought he would.Dirty Nights is a story that should be read. Not for the dancing or the hot sex, but for the stories of people who go beyond what is expected of them, despite pain, nightmares, and hardship. Emerson St. Clair (A.M. Hargrove) has a gift for showing people's souls and giving them the happiness that they deserve.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A Dark Romance....", "unixReviewTime": 1400198400, "reviewTime": "05 16, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A23D2VF7Q5ONLY", "asin": "B00K6KBKEY", "reviewerName": "Amazon Customer", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "For anyone who is a nerd.

This novel is set in a fabulous location, namely, The Greek Island of Mykonos. The protagonist, Helena, goes to visit her aunt Sophie. While there, she meets Dimitris, a character who is quite likeable. With the romantic elements in place, we now turn to the mystery of her father's disappearance many years ago. A diary serves as a source to drive the plot forward. Slowly, but surely, a realization dawns upon the reader. Finally, we come to question whether or not Dimitrius is everything that he appears to be on the surface.

I'm an avid fan of gay romance and have read close to 600 titles in the months since I first bought my Kindle.  I don't limit myself to any ONE particular kind of story.  I read the GFY stories, and the Coming Out stories, and the Sweet Love stories and the angsty Dramatic Love Stories, and even a few of the BDSM stories------  But my favorites are the stories that have some comedy in them.  Nick Pageant gives us a  TOTAL comedy.  I laughed at every page--  Every kind of laugh from chuckles to belly laughs to tears-streaming-down-my-face uncontrolable laughs.  The lead character, Mason has a sense of wit and self-effacing, urbane humor that makes it impossible not to laugh at every bit of his dialogue with the other characters in the story, as well as an hilarious  INNER dialogue in his head that he shares with the reader!  But, please don't think there isn't a real, hearfelt love story going on beneath all the humor.  Mason isn't the character that we see in so many of these gay romances.  No, he's not 6' tall with gorgeous eyes and muscles on top of muscles.  Intstead, he's 5'5&#34; tall with a so-so body, and he constantly wears cardigan sweaters.  He is what I call a &#34;pocket gay&#34;---  a cute little sweetheart that you just want to pick up and put in your pocket.  And he's not a football jock or a business tycoon.  No, he's a LIBRARIAN!!!  We all know the stereotype of the quiet little librarian.  But that is NOT Mason!  He's a fiesty little guy with a wicked sense of humor and a funny outlook on life.  I could so easily fall in love with him if I ever met him in real life!!  And that whole librarian-thing is an added bonus because I was a Library Science major in college and worked for a number of years in various libraries.  Where, oh where was MY &#34;Mason&#34; back when I was in the stacks?  If YOU think YOU are a Mason-type of guy, give me a call so we can run away together and live happily ever after!  (just kidding.........or not)Don't think for an instant, though, that Mason is the only funny, real-life-like character in Pageant's book.  No, not at all.  Pageant fills the story with an array of delightful characters........from Mason's lesbian, biker Granny, to Mason's sassy best friend, Twyla (every gay man needs a sassy best friend, of the female persuasion), to the lovable jail-bird, Shawn.  And for those of you looking for that tall, well-built, jock type of guy----  There's Shane.  Shane is the kind of guy that we THINK would never be interested in a short, wiry librarian like Mason.  But it turns out that Shane is a real sweetheart and he's been lusting for Mason ever since they first met (when Shane's running shorts got pulled down exposing his pink no-no in a minor jogging accident).  I would explain that in more detail, but I don't want to spoil that hilarious scene for you before you get to read it for yourself.  Now stop waiting around and go out and buy this book. After you've wiped away the tears of laughter from your face, you'll thank me for suggesting that you read this book.And to Nick-----  I'm going out to read your other stories as soon as I have this review posted and on its way.

Her latest installment Inked, just cemented that reputation.What makes Ms. Snow&#8217;s MC series so wonderful is her ability to write interesting characters that I enjoy reading about. She is able to show the hero&#8217;s sweet and caring side without detracting from his macho, alpha, tough guy reputation. She also writes her heroines as smart, sassy, independent women who inspire their men to be better people.Cadeon and Stella are just two more examples of this. Stella is the daughter of the Vicious Bastards MC Club so she is no stranger to the dangerous life of an MC Club. She has always been loved and protected by these dangerous men so she has no fear of them. But Stella has been afraid to go after the man that she has been crushing on for three years. Cadeon is the owner of the tattoo parlor where the Vicious Bastards get their ink. He has lusted after Stella from afar ever since he met her, but has too many concerns about getting involved with her. First of all, he&#8217;s almost twice her age. Second, he doesn&#8217;t consider himself a nice guy and thinks that Stella deserves better. Finally, she&#8217;s the President&#8217;s daughter and that comes with its own risks.When the two finally get together, their romance actually turns into a sweet, loving story. I enjoyed watching Cadeon realize how much Stella means to him and his desire to be the man that she deserves.  Their relationship was authentic and I didn&#8217;t even mind their age difference because they still had so much in common. They made sense as a couple and I was absolutely cheering for them to get their happy ever after. And let&#8217;s not forget their chemistry because it was definitely hot.Ms. Snow also devotes as much attention to the secondary characters as she does the main ones because they are just as interesting. I especially enjoyed the interactions with Stella and her father as he learned to accept that she was an adult with a love life.Inked is a quick read coming in at less than 100 pages but Ms. Snow did not shortchange the reader.

He is a widow with a grown up son and an owl shifter who suddenly finds himself face to face with his mate. A very young human mate who has no idea that shifters even exist.Dylan Sudderson walks with the aid of crutches after being hit by a drunk driver. He is cosseted by his parents, particularly his mother, and is terrified of them finding out he is gay. I liked Dylan. He needed someone to love him and look beyond his disability and scars and to help all the self doubt he carried. He was so desperate for Luc to want him, but so sure that he wouldn&#8217;t that it made you want to cry for him.Besides the love story this is about a very mixed group of shifters who have to deal with an out of control Alpha who is kidnapping and torturing humans. The shifters are diverse in their nature and are joined by a couple of vampires. Luc is a loyal member of this group and an ideal candidate for Beta to the new Alpha Dorian.I am going to go back to start this series from the beginning.

Her treats her like s***, and she's only staying with him for the sake of her son Theo.\"Many women went through their lives in an unhappy marriage. I was no different to any of them. Not everyone found their Mr. Darcy and lived happily ever after, some people just had to take what they could get and be grateful. Clearly I was one of those people.\"Harrison Baxter is her brother in law's sexy business partner, the man she has sexy thoughts about. A man who is so not like her husband. Harrison is a ladies' man, but has always had had a thing for Bronwyn, but knows she is married, and off limits, but can't get her out of his mind and can't resist flirting with her every time fate seems to bring then together.\"Harrison Baxter. The one that made my panties wet every time he smiled at me\"Reason Not To Fall In Love was a heartwarming entertaining read. I felt for Bronwyn at times the way she was treated by her husband over the years had left her will low self-esteem. I'm sure there are many women out there who are in the same situation in loveless marriages as it easy to stay than to leave. But at the same time I wanted to shake her and make her see that she worth so much more.Bronwyn and Harrison were great characters. You could feel the magnet pull between. Love the flirting, chemistry and the banter they share. Love that Harrison saw something more in her, always made her smile, and I couldn't help but want them to be together.\"I don't just want one night Bronwyn; I never did, not with you.\"\"His voice did funny things inside I was lost for words\"Overall I really enjoyed this novella it may be a short read, but it was a good read, (There will be no comments from me about how long it was ;) ) once I started I didn't want to put it down, and one I easily read in a few hours.  It was another well-written story from the talented Kirsty Moseley who kept me guessing with a few good twists. Loved the last one. If Kirsty choose to continue Bronwyn and Harrison's story then I will happily read it, but if she doesn't then that is okay with me as I liked the way it ended for them.

So when I finished this book, I am pretty sure I sat with my mouth agape for like a good 15 minutes processing all that happened and I was still thinking about it like an hour later. This book is THAT good.Mia/Paige is running away from horrendous past, a past that will make you cringe and cower in a corner; one that most people would not be able to survive. But Mia is a survivor, she is strong, tough, feisty, determined and pretty much downright fearless at least when it comes to defending herself. But there is something that Mia fears and its letting someone into her heart, letting someone get so close to her that they find out her secret. You see Mia has never had anyone, no friends and no true family that cares for her. She has been taking care of herself and trying to live through her situation all on her own. So what happens when she finds herself in a small town surrounded by people who are willing to accept her despite her secrets, well Mia's world is flipped upside down but in a good way.Mia becomes immersed in a world where she doesn't have to be watching her back constantly, a world where she can laugh and smile, a world where she can possibly love those around her. But soon that world is threatened and the past comes chasing after her like bat out of hell. I don't want to give too much away but this book is quite a ride. The emotions and intensity run on a constant level &#34;holy guacomole and OMGs&#34; there is not one dull moment in this story and never once did I feel like any of the plot was dragging. James does a flawless job of expressing the emotions and mental anguish of some of the characters sometimes by just simply describing the situations rather then using inner dialogue which can be a challenge. I loved how all the characters in the story added something different to Mia's life. They all play a role in who she is to become and what she will have to do. James creates a story where all the players have their own individuals flaws, fears or secrets but all together they make a unit that is both loving and powerful.

There isn't anything terribly wrong about this book, just a lackluster story overall.The idea is fun. An ordinary lady is in need of change after a failed relationship. She buys a remote house site unseen. The house is haunted by two ridiculously hot guys who instantly fall in love with her. Only she can break the curse, but they are mostly limited to light touches and cold breezes so communication is an issue.The lady is an author, which is a cliche and overused career. The book has fairly explicit erotica. Everyone has the stereotypical no tension / instant acceptance response to a menage, so no tension there. The biggest problem was the minimal interpersonal communication between the romantic partners, which leaves the guys about as interesting as a pair of vibrators.

The courts would've granted custody rights. Needless to say her plan backfired & she waisted years of her life resentful of a man who was not ever in love with her. Ouch!I feel that Cass was aware of Maya & Gabe's love but the writer didn't give him closure. This was an opportunity to confirm that Gabe or her love for him, had ruined her for any other man. There was also the tremendous burden of discussing their past relationship with both set of parents, the apologies both eluded to and the idea that somehow Anna Ben knew about their love affair.

Emma Braun is a sixteen-year-old American girl living in Brussels, a budding violin virtuoso.  Her violin teacher , Monsieur Dupriez, has gone missing, as have several other violinists.  She and her best friend Annika decide that they are going to investigate, eventually joining forces with Corey Fletcher, another of Monsieur Dupriez' students.  The three of them stumble upon a truly imaginative mystery that they have to solve in order to save lives, their own and others.This book is a wonderful mix of mystery and fantasy, even a little bit of light romance.  But it was the intrigue and mystery that was the foundation of the plot.  I was initially disappointed because I figured out who the villain was very early in the story and I assumed that it was going to ruin the rest of the book.  However, while I figured out the \"whodunit\" fairly quickly, it was the \"whydunit\" that was truly the heart of the story.There was a lot of suspense and anticipation in this story which kept me turning the pages.  Sherlock Holmes fans will appreciate the plethora of references to him throughout the novel.  The target audience is young adult, but the story is easily engaging for older readers.  Although I have found no reference to this book being a part of a series, there is a bit of an opening at the end that would lend itself nicely to at least a sequel.Things to love...--Corey.  I love that there was a male character who was as much a part of the story as a female character.  I have sons and I am constantly looking for books with more male presence and this one fits nicely.--The interesting take on an old theme.  Making a pact with the devil is a common theme, but I liked how Calvani used it in a new way.Some Quotastic Goodness--At first she had thought they were a string of coincidences, but not anymore. While scowling at obnoxious Billie Lynam during school recess, for instance, she wished he would fall flat on his face&#8230; and half a minute later, her wish was granted (Loc. 60).--To her horror, someone was already hiding in there. Her gasp was muffled as a strong hand closed over her mouth.

Determined to emulate her favorite literary hero, Sherlock Holmes, she sets about investigating, forming new alliances and uncovering centuries-old secrets about her family&#8217;s luthier craft and her aloof grandfather, to whom she is apprenticed.

Given the characters and simple yet descriptive writing, the target audience is young adult, although older readers will enjoy this story as well.

Colton's little sister Sophie is shy and just beginning to try and be more assertive.  Colton wants to make sure she has a good time during the festivities and doesn't try and skip out of them.  He asks best man and best friend Logan to do the honors.  Logan is seriously overstressed with his company.  Sure he built it up by himself and sure it's really hit the big time, but now he doesn't even have time to do the things he loves, the whole reason he started the company in the first place.No doubt Colton realized this too and figured asking Logan to look out for Sophie was a way to kill two birds with one stone. He just didn't realize how well it would work.  Sophie is really into Logan and boy is he ever into her.  But every time things start to get comfy cozy, work intrudes.  Good thing Sophie isn't too demanding, she'd have left Logan in her dust.  Once Logan figures out Sophie's the one for him, he needs to figure out what he's going to do because he needs some serious time for her.  The &#34;big misunderstanding&#34; happens late in the game and by the time it happens, it's pretty obvious that it will be resolved quickly.The epilogue completing the series was cute and funny and really brought the whole series to a close in a nice package.

Bounty hunters, some of which have been after her and her mom all her life, are after her now. When Kayla is cornered by Patrick and Shaun, two of the hunters, while trying to figure out how to clear her name, the game of survival just kicked into overdrive. Honestly, I have mixed feelings about this one. There were parts I really liked, parts that were exciting, parts that were mysterious, parts that were predictable, and parts that just didn't work for me. Here's a bit of what I liked and didn't like:What I Liked:&#8226; I would place this between Mature Young Adult and New Adult. I liked that this is a gentler transition between the genres. Kayla is 18 and Shaun is 20-something. But it's from Kayla's POV and reads as an 18-year-old. While there is sexuality, it is not the heavily-ladled borderline erotica many &#34;new adult&#34; books are putting out there.&#8226; The main characters had sympathetic pasts that had a decent complexity. I enjoyed getting to know them. Kayla is a tough girl, a survivor, who has lived a very unique life, and she never quits. I liked her, even though she was easily distracted by a cute boy. And Shaun's backstory, especially the bits with Patrick, was both heart-breaking and sweet. Once you get past the superficial, Shaun is very endearing.&#8226; There was a certain complexity that Accardo created that made the story interesting and not run-of-the-mill. There's mystery and suspense, trying to puzzle missing pieces together, trying to read through lies, deceptions, and misconceptions. While some of it was predictable, it was still interesting and thoughtful.&#8226; Though the mistakes here were big and far-reaching, it does showcase that even parents make mistakes, and how a child might cope with those mistakes, forgive, trust, and unconditionally love.&#8226; I liked the ending and the story itself felt complete. Not everything was all rainbows and flowers in the end, but what started as a very difficult reality for Kayla, ended with peace and hope, and I liked that.Not so much:&#8226; The first chapter sets the precedence for the tone of the book that didn't sit great with me, and affected the rest of the read. Kayla doesn't run away. Kayla kept trying to read the letter instead of stuffing it in her pocket for later when she was out of mortal danger. Kayla's eying Shaun like she's never seen a cute boy before. Kayla says there's no alternative exit when there's suddenly an exit. No one seems to have any weapons or protection. Of course, if she had the letter there would have been no story, but I was still bothered by the girl's poor choices. It set a precedence for future blunders.&#8226; Insta-whatever it was. I don't mind insta-attraction or even insta-love in general. I remember the first time I met my husband fondly. But for me the &#34;insta&#34; between Kayla and Shaun just didn't work for me considering the delicate situation they were in to begin with. In the first few chapters, reading about all the flirty looks and lusting and being so easily distracted just felt far-fetched and forced. They were in a life-threatening situation minutes into meeting each other. There should be no googly eyes! Their growing feelings felt more realistic, but the beginning kinda ruined the spark for me.&#8226; A couple predictable parts I figured out and was just waiting for Kayla to catch up. And there were a few things that were just off or plot holes, which I won't spoil. The book was still enjoyable, but these left it a little less satisfying.Overall, this standalone was a quick, enjoyable read for me, but nothing to jump up and down about. I love Accardo's Denazen series, and her writing here was still really good, I just didn't like it as much. But I am still a fan of Accardo and will continue to read her books. But don't let me discourage you.

All she's used to it is to blend in, to never trust anyone and to use her brain to get her out of difficult times.But Kayla had to go back to the place her mom died to try to figure out what and who she's running from. And that's where we first find her.Patrick Tanner is a bounty hunter. He's been after the Morgan girl all his life and this time he has a little help to capture Kayla. Meet Shaun Denver. Hot, smart, witty, tattoed (we all love some inked guys) and absolutely infuriating.Where Kayla is the kind of person who needs a plan to feel secure and know where she's going, Shaun is the type who jumps into the situations and goes with it. Kayla is the brains, she's not a fighter AT ALL but she can deliver some serious BS to get her out of trouble. Shaun on the hand will use those pretty muscles without a second thought.What I loved most about this book is how Jus managed to keep the suspence, giving us little pieces of information at sthe time to keep the story going but still being able to surprise you with the final outcome.The characters feel real. Both have past that haunts them in their own way and things they aren't ready to face. Jus managed to make them  Bad-Ass and vulnerable at the same time.And of course the fact that (like any of her books) Jus just throws you into the story in the first page. It manges to capture and hold you in until the last page and then, it leaves you wanting more.

This oh so sweet and sexy read will grab you from the first page.Solider Kale Montgomery meets school teacher, Lucy Dawson on the day he is fulfilling his godfather duties for 'Bring Your Daddy To Work Day'. They immediately hit it off. However, Kale is known as a ladies man. No settling down for him. Soon enough their playful banter turns into flirting and eventually into friends with benefits. With Kale's upcoming deployment, the 'what are we question' arises. Neither one wants to admit it, but they have fallen for each other. Hard. When lines are crossed, their past comes back to haunt them. Obstacles are thrown their way. It challenges their beliefs of  love. They are reminded why they always stayed away from love. But this is Kale and Lucy. Their love is like no other.&#34;I have every intention of making her mine, but until I know she&#8217;s ready, hell, until I&#8217;m sure that I&#8217;m even ready, I&#8217;ll bid my time and continue to be her best friends... I know that in the end it&#8217;ll be more than worth it. Waiting for her will be worth it.&#34;Time apart does nothing to dim the flame (pun intended) between Kale and Lucy. Their passionate summer fling is so much more than they ever imagined. Friends with benefits? Sexy times with your best friend? What more can you want? They soon learn that the thought of being without each other is no longer an option. Life makes so much more sense when they are together. Even when life throws curves, Lucy and Kale face them head one. No matter what, Kale and Lucy always find HOME within each other.&#8220;Home isn&#8217;t just a place for me, babe. It&#8217;s wherever you are. So we could be at my place, at your place, or in a van by the river. As long as I&#8217;m with you, then I&#8217;m home.&#8221;Inflame is so much more than a friends with benefits or friends to lovers story. Why? Because it goes much DEEPER than that. The connection between Kale and Lucy is felt the moment they met. The reason they never found true love? Because their souls were still looking for each other. That is the kind of love that exists between them. Their love goes beyond what they could have ever imagined. They found love when they least expected it-when they weren't looking. But love doesn't work that way. It finds you when you're ready. With the right person. Inflame attests to that.&#8220;All my time with you is the best times infinity, Kale Montgomery.&#8221;Kale Montgomery. You have absolutely stolen my heart when I least expected it. You are not only drop dead gorgeous, you are kind and you also hold the most beautiful soul I've ever met in a hero in a story. Kale loves with everything he has. With all of his heart and soul. With conviction. Kale. Just. Loves. He protects. He is possessive, yet compassionate. He will make you laugh. He will also make you cry. And you will love him even harder through both.&#34;And just like that, Lucy Dawson shines the light in my life and my dark thoughts completely disappear.&#34;While you can read Inflame as a standalone, I highly suggest you read the other books in this series.

Now, not only has her baby sister has turned traitor and agreed to marry the oldest Loveless Brother, the middle brother just out-bid her on her dream house.Knox Loveless can't fully fathom why he lets Wilhelmina Dunn get under his skin, it's just been that way since a teenage bet changed their relationship all of those years ago.  It's none of her business why he joined the Historical Society Board, or that building &#34;McMansions&#34; with no character irritates him.

Can another bet change their relationship again?Willa is often described in the book as being passionate or high-strung.  That is actually a spot on description.  I loved how the author doesn't leave out the ugly bits of a passionate personality.  Passionate people do tend to be self-centered and make a habit of walking over people to achieve their goals.  Being passionate is not a terrible thing, but people like that do need someone in their life (a friend, family member, or partner) to ground then and keep them from alienating people.All of the characters in this book have massive flaws that the author uses to benefit the story.  The &#34;drama queen&#34; sister isn't chastised, but accepted; the blustering father isn't turned into a villain, just a typical big personality; the &#34;other guy&#34; is actually likable, despite committing a huge social gaffe.Overall, I really liked this book.

Disappointed? oh no!!!I actually enjoyed and even loved it. The writer has a great way of writing that had me drawn into the story. Her characters were believable, loveable and I wanted to cause bodily harm to Daniel's brother a few times within the book.Loving Mr. Daniels had so much intensity, love, laughter, sadness and most of all love.

It contained stories of drugs, murder, homosexuality and cancer. Tie everything I just mentioned into a book and I got a GREAT read.The Story revolves around Ashlyn. Ashlyn who is broken because of the lost of a love one is trying to find out how to live with that person. Her relationship with her parents who are separated isn't the best and a decision is made for her to move to Edgewood, Wisconsin. On her way to Edgewood, she cannot keep her eyes off the strange man with blue hypnotic eyes on the train.&#34;His eyes were so blue and filled with interest.

Strong and protective, he is also sweet and tender. He is a gentle giant that isn't scared of his emotions and of showing them. He isn't afraid of loving although due to his past he would have every reason to. The confidence to be who he is, to not compromise, to allow himself to feel and be true to those emotions, makes him not only super out-of-this world swoon-worthy but also sexy as hell. He knows his priorities and is his own person - always true to himself.There is nothing, and I mean nothing about him to dislike. It doesn't mean he might not have any flaws, but they are damn hard to notice or care about. He might be the most perfect book boyfriend ever written - perfect without being irritating or unrealistic. I really don't think my words can do him justice.The way he loves Jamie - wholeheartedly and unconditionally without disregarding his own feeling, the way he treats her with devotion and reverence and utmost respect, it melted my heart, took my breath away and made me smile so big I feared my face will split in two. Despite his past he isn't bitter or cold, but instead emotionally available and open. He is all male and yet sensitive. He does the sweetest things without being corny and his actions, feelings and thoughts made me melt like ice-cream on a hot summer's day.Really, I could go on gushing about him for hours and yet, I wouldn't manage to paint a picture that is true to his character.Jamie, on the other hand, I was prepared to dislike. She seemed all hung up on her on-and-off waste of a space boyfriend and my first instinct was to slap her for using Tor. Damn, was I proven wrong. Unlike my assumptions, she isn't one to play with anyone. She is just an extremely loyal girl, who out of guilt and a sense of obligation sacrifices her life and happiness for a love long gone wrong. She has a hard time letting go of what has been her dream for a fairytale future, disregarding the fact that the frog is no prince and that the fairytale has turned into a nightmare. It is not that she is ignorant to reality. But sometimes it is hard to accept the truth, despite seeing it clearly. And that is the situation Jamie is in. Torn between her longing for happiness and the guilt that keeps her stuck in a toxic and unhealthy situation, it takes Tor thundering into her life  and after one night of passion flipping it upside down, for her to consider that life has to offer more than constant misery and agony.And with a complete new future that fate forced upon her, step by step she finds the motivation to let go of the guilt and obligation that keeps her captive and to allow Tor to win her heart. With every touch, with every word he proves to her, that he is there for her no matter what and shows her that true love is beautiful, sweet and gives instead of just taking and destroying everything in its path. She realizes it is important to let go of the past in order to have a shot at a future.And for Tor she is willing to do just that. She learns to let him into her life and into her heart.Despite their pasts, they both get a second chance at love and it is beautiful, yet bittersweet at the same time. The way they are with each other touched my heart with its sweetness and brought tears to my eyes. The love they share made me weep and sob at times - even more so when they share their feelings with us readers at the end of the book. They might be scarred, but not broken by their pasts.But sometimes the past worms its way back in and Jamie's past threatens to destroy the second chance her and Tor got, threatening their happiness and their future. True love is worth fighting for though and fight they did.Do yourself the favor and don't miss out on this beautiful, bittersweet love story and let the gentle Viking win your heart.5+ emotional, true-love-that-is-worth-fighting-for stars.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Extraordinary and beautiful", "unixReviewTime": 1400976000, "reviewTime": "05 25, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A1098Z3D7ENJ2F", "asin": "B00KA0JEHU", "reviewerName": "veronica mostel", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "All of these books were awesome.  l have read all of them.

Ruddock", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "This is a novel that most definitely falls in the Crime and Detective genre. Although set in the present day, this is very much a good old fashioned detective story and reads very much like a Ray Chandler or Sam Spade novel; if it weren't for the occasional references to modern technology, the reader could almost imagine themselves in a period 1930's murder investigation. It's the classic story of an old school detective teamed up with a tenacious young female reporter, determined to get to the bottom of the of the seemingly motiveless murder of a high class call girl: Throw in a Senate Governor, a jealous wife, and a mysterious killer lurking in the background, and you have all the ingredients of a an engaging and fast-paced 'who and why they did it story.' There are a number of sub-plots and unexpected turns that slowly and cleverly fall into place to form the overall story. The ending was not what I was expecting, and is suggestive that this might well be just the first in a longer series of such stories.If I had but one tiny criticism it would be that I do think there is just the slightest over reliance on semi-colons in the first half of the story, but again, I say that based on my own reading and writing preferences, and I suspect other readers may well disagree with me on this.Despite not being a dedicated fan of &#8216;classic&#8217; detective novels, I did find this story to be well written, enjoyable and entertaining. One of the things I don't usually enjoy with some detective novels is when the author tries to impress with almost Sherlock Holmes levels of analysis and clues that would take a super computer to figure out. In &#8216;Max's Mayhem&#8217;, Amber Hawkins manages to get the balance more or less just right to intrigue and hold the reader's interest without drowning them in procedural detail, relying instead on the detective's and the reporter's respective instincts and experience to move the story forward.At sixty two pages, this is more a novella than a full length novel, but packed within those pages is a story that fans of the murder, crime, and detective genres will really enjoy.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great book!", "unixReviewTime": 1403136000, "reviewTime": "06 19, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A3MR5O0H7E07EA", "asin": "B00KAF4V7S", "reviewerName": "Gordon Merritt", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "Read the entire series, could not wait to get to each succeeding novel, really hoping Jay Allan keeps it going!!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Crimson World series was great!", "unixReviewTime": 1405468800, "reviewTime": "07 16, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A348JYMJGX9GQ", "asin": "B00KAF4V7S", "reviewerName": "J.

From start to finish I could not put Girl of Rage down. (It may have accompanied me through my kids&#8217; bedtime routines, kept me up past my bedtime, and infiltrated my dreams even after I had finished.) Where the middle installment of many trilogies fall flat, this one captured my attention and held on until I lost several hours buried in the book.Girl of Rage picks up right where Girl of Lies left off. And from the very beginning the action is on. I was grateful for the way it picked up. It&#8217;s been nearly half a year since I read Girl of Lies, and as I opened to the first page, I couldn&#8217;t remember exactly what had happened, except that I was worried about Dylan. The ending points of the first book were subtly referred to without taking up a lot of description, so that my memory came back without it being too much retelling for people who may read them back to back.Each sister and their parents have their own mysteries to work through. Rachel&#8217;s illness has taken a backseat to the turmoil the family finds itself in. Julia and Crank face issues with their business. Andrea and Dylan are still on the run and out of contact with the rest of the family, causing added stress for Alexandra. Adelina and Jessica are also running on the opposite coast. And amidst all the danger to the girls, no one hears from their father.The secrets that are revealed in Girl of Rage begin to answer the question about what is really going on, but there are just as many new questions as there are answered ones, and the truth is far from clear.The one thing some might question about Girl of Rage is where is the romance. Several potential romantic pairings have been hinted at, but the root conflict in Rachel&#8217;s Peril as a whole is the family secrets, which don&#8217;t need to be confused with romantic overtones. I never missed a romantic storyline through either Girl of Lies or Girl of Rage. There was far too much action to miss anything!This series is one of my favorite spin-offs. It has taken the families created in the original trilogy and turned everything we thought we knew on it&#8217;s head. It was so fast paced, filled with so much mystery and hidden truths that I couldn&#8217;t help being sucked right back into the Thompsons&#8217; lives.I was gifted a copy in exchange for my honest review.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fast paced, page turner!", "unixReviewTime": 1402272000, "reviewTime": "06 9, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "AK45ICOJIL7U9", "asin": "B00KAJE9YE", "reviewerName": "Anne R", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "Whoa.

This was a cute, sweet little novella. It is short enough to read in one sitting and low angst enough to enjoy regardless of my frame of mind at the time. There is a little angst, can't have a romance novella without it; just not enough to bring me down.As a sequel, it was good to catch up with the characters in the previous two books. One of the main characters in A Fighting Man is the brother of one of the main characters in A Marrying Man. Slater Cassidy and Casper Kennedy actually met in the previous book, but this is their entire story.Since Slater laid eyes on Casper, he has wanted him. He is an Army Ranger on deployment in Afghanistan, but that doesn't stop him from pursuing Casper relentlessly. He tries everything from flowers to a strip-o-gram to win Casper's affections.Casper has suffered a deeply painful loss in his past. One that has made him determined to close off his heart, especially to a soldier. He has to admit that he finds Slater almost irresistible. He is front and center in many of Casper's solitary fantasies.Both of these characters are funny, sexy, smart, and my personal favorite, sarcastic wise-asses. Ms. Gasq-Dion has written some very funny, fast paced dialogue between the two men and also the supporting characters in this story.A tragedy occurs that brings up painful memories and feelings for Casper and brings out the worst in Slater. Watching them both struggle to overcome their emotional and physical hurdles was a really good read. In a book like this, you kind of know how it is going to end, but getting there was great fun this time around.A few secondary characters that we meet in A Fighting Man are prime candidates for books of their own. I could see another couple of books in this series. I will be one of the first on line to buy them if they come about. The Men of Manhattan are an enjoyable lot and I hope to read more of them.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great Series", "unixReviewTime": 1404604800, "reviewTime": "07 6, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "AKWBRE0JKA2A1", "asin": "B00KAS8B7G", "reviewerName": "Amazon Customer \"Know what I like\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "I am just too stoked with Ms. RR's talent at weaving her magic and cannot give her less than 5 stars.

I have everyone of her books on my Kindle, but I was actually a little disappointing with this book. Please don't get me wrong, I didn't have a problem with any of the characters, plot, or ending. I just found it a little better than ok. Yes, I am glad that I purchased it, but I did not experience the satisfaction that I ordinarily feel when I see \"The End\" in her books.Pros:Characters were awesome, supportive, and constant throughout the novel. Often, I have felt the Dark Haven series doesn't have the sense of family that her Club Shadowlands does. This book changed that for me. There was family and community. I really loved the support and domination of the characters throughout the book.Cherise was pretty funny. She incorporated a lot more humor in the narrative, and I really appreciated that Lindsey, who is clearly not a masochist, was a little feisty.  She definitely has a mouth on her and deVries was more than cool with it. Sure, he went into dom mode a few times as a result. But in reality, not every sub is tight-lipped. So I really appreciated that we get a sub that is feisty, asserts her independence (even if she isn't successful), and is isn't punished or considered recalcitrant. So tons of points to Cherise for that.We get to see some new types of play introduced by The Enforcer. Electrocism and knife play are there, and of course she writes the scenes with excellence. Unfortunately, I didn't feel the steaminess that many people have written about, and I really wish that I did. But to be clear, they are great together, and I believed every scene. I just was not as hot for them.deVries is a sadist, and while Cherise mentioned that she pushed her limits a bit when writing him, I think she did an excellent job with his dialogue. I found his responses very realistic when he was being a top. I believed them, and that really made me happy.Cons:It was predictable. I pretty much guessed A to B to C. Of course she threw in a few elements in each step that I didn't anticipate, but I had a general idea of where things where going.As a few other reviewers have mentioned, the end did seem a little rushed. But to Cherise's credit, I don't know what I could have suggested differently. The ended wasn't dissatisfying, but it did seem short and quick.Maybe a spoiler, but for once, we have no final scene at the end. WHAT?!! That was a surprise and one I wish had not been there. I think it would have been nice to have scene to help with dealing and healing some of the scares from the past.deVries. Oh deVries..... So he has some issues. That is acceptable to me. I have no problem with that. And yes, he is kind of a teddy bear, and I think that represent many sadists. But I found myself frustrated with him going back-and-forth, and by his inappropriate responses to things not involving intimacy or bdsm play. He jumped to the same conclusions inappropriately a few times, and that was irritating, though very human. Yes, you know it's a great author when they can create a character that makes you frustrated and feel a certain way. But we all have our opinions, and I am not as in love with him as her other characters. Perhaps it was because I found him far more compromising than her other alpha doms. But I do think he has great character and is a good sadist who has needs like the rest of us.Over all, I would put this novel a little better than Master of the Abyss which is Jake and Kallie's novel, which I rated as three stars. I never thought I'd have to rate one of Cherise's books so low again, but I honestly found it just okay, and I'm genuinely sorry to say that.

As with This Is Who I Am (Masters of the Shadowlands #7), Ms Sinclair wrote a great story filled with a good plot, tasteful, descriptive and HOT sex scenes and an alpha male who is not only a hero but a card carrying sadist.Even though Zander deVries is a sadist he has the softest underbelly, a full and caring heart. Having lived a life filled with hurt, sadness, betrayal, and violence carried out in the name of the greater good, he seems to have control over his life. It is his need to satisfy his sadistic side, within the safety and Non-judgmental environment of Dark Haven, that allows him to find that control. Seeing the whole person and not just his sadistic nature reminds the reader that what one does sexually doesn't dictate the type of person they really are.The books heroine, Lindsey is on the run from her past. She&#8217;s a strong, outspoken, not gonna take any crap women, whose afraid to let other&#8217;s get too close to her, fearing they will be drawn into the mess she is hiding from. She&#8217;s a sexual submissive, but not a masochist.The pairing of deVries and Lindsey is the story of polar opposites, a couple who find a middle ground to allow their relationship to bloom and grow into a constant bouquet of love and need.. Their path is plagued with mis-steps by both parties, angry words that never should have been said, and assumptions that never should have been made. The connection between deVries and Lindsey starts in the beginning of the book (or should I say seemed to have started in My Liege of Dark Haven (Mountain Masters & Dark Haven #3)) and just never lets up. The connection and chemistry is strong, and the sexual scenes between the two are creative, exciting and hot.Supporting our H/h are characters we've met in the previous Mountain Master / Dark Haven books, the friendship, support and non-judgmental attitudes are prevalent in this book as well.This is a standalone book, no cliff hanger, plot complete with no loose ends, and a satisfying HEA. The writing is good as is the editing.For me a five star read, and a big soft spot for deVries", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great book", "unixReviewTime": 1400371200, "reviewTime": "05 18, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A31ADELWSH4HAH", "asin": "B00KBA6PKS", "reviewerName": "K Roelkey \"Kgirl\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "Just finished Edge of the Enforcer (Doms of Dark Haven) by Cherise Sinclair.

Yeah didn&#8217;t think those would mix but he pulls it off and Cherise&#8217;s writing makes it believable.  The scenes were hot!

The writing was so good your rational mind takes a vacation and you are sucked in wishing you were the one he ran that knife over or maybe the flogger.  :)Lindsey is running from the law and has a new name, in short she has issues.  Of course every story needs conflict and Lindsey&#8217;s is a doozy.  But she didn&#8217;t grate my nerves or make me feel she was to weak.  Yet still submissive, there was a good balance in her character and I like the Texas charm she showed.At any rate it was a good story that I would recommend to friends.

After being involved with a dangerous man, she is fleeing from false murder charges and finds herself in San Francisco. Worried that her past might come to haunt her, Lindsay takes on small jobs to keep under the radar. However, with that comes a lot of life hassles and less than hygeineic living conditions.When deVries, the sadist of the Dark Haven BDSM club, finds out about this, he takes her under his wing. His helping hand scares Lindsey at first because she isn&#8217;t used to comfort coming from deVries &#8211; just pain. While deVries starts off as a mean bastard in the beginning, he softens, showing readers a different side to him that had me falling in love with him. At first their relationship starts off strained. If you&#8217;ve read the last book in the series, you know that Lindsey still owes deVries a blowjob and anal sex from the games. When he wants to cash in, it puts Lindsey in a vulnerable state. As a sadist, deVries likes to inflict more pain than she can handle, so a lot of the book is Lindsey trying to meet his needs.What I love about this book is that the characters feel very real. There are several dimensions to them. Sometimes you love them. Sometimes you hate them. Sometimes you question their decisions and other times, you cannot be more than happy with them. Having readers go through those type of emotions in a single book is hard to do, but Cherise Sinclair is one of those authors who is able to do it each time with her books.I love the suspense subplot to the storyline. It&#8217;s one of the things I love most about Sinclair&#8217;s books. While she takes some leaps, they never seem so out there that they seem foolish. This realistic aspect to the book always makes it believable and that&#8217;s why I always find her books so entertaining to read.There is one scene in this book that didn&#8217;t do it for me. I&#8217;m not a fan of edge play. Knives freak me out, so that particularly scene was read pretty quickly. However, as you can expect, the rest of the sex scenes are well-written and will no doubt stay true to the characters. Depending on personal preferences, Sinclair does have something for everyone. This is, once again, something I love about Sinclair. In every book, she tries something new. Another kink is explored. She is never limiting herself and her books continue to grow because of that.*ARC provided by publisher", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "read pretty quickly.", "unixReviewTime": 1401494400, "reviewTime": "05 31, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A3B3842S0LRKL9", "asin": "B00KBA817I", "reviewerName": "Stephanie Williamsx", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "I'm glad Jane and Ace got it together...I couldn't really see them with anyone else..This book picked up right where 2 left off and was just as great...Wonderful job India....", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Loooved it", "unixReviewTime": 1401321600, "reviewTime": "05 29, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A3ML02P3E66ET1", "asin": "B00KBAKWFM", "reviewerName": "Shurrn", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "I have to say, I am endlessly impressed by the consistent quality of this series.

He is my favorite male character from the entire series..he's sweet, strong, loving, caring, sexy as all sin, and most important of all, understanding. He goes very slowly with Liv so that she can be comfortable and he allows her to feel as if she is in control of the situation.

This book was exciting, the mutated animals hunting them and their time on Sylvan's home planet, it was all just phenomenal. I enjoyed Sophia's incident at dinner...that was absolutely hilarious!!Sought: Kat is my favorite female character overall...She's feisty and witty. She ends up linked to Far & Deep and they have to go to their home planet to save Kat. They have to go on a journey to the ancient areas of their planet to find a flower to heal her. This one was a definite tear jerker.Found: Xairn! Oh man, he's a doozy. Since he had his first scene in the book I knew he would end up being a good guy.

It was such a beautiful and moving story of heartbreak and grief but also hope, joy and love.{Was he that transparent? Was it so clear that he searched for anything to fill the void that had become his life?}Andrew grew up in a world devoid of love, hardly ever seeing his parents, looked after by nannies. It left a void in his life, one he has filled with aimless pleasures but, deep down, he has always been seeking something more meaningful in his life.{She longed to feel it all. To feel anything but the imminent horror of her mother&#8217;s lingering illness. An illness that had slowly stolen her mother&#8217;s vitality and ensured that any dreams Ophelia had were but distant memories.}Cast aside by her half-brother, after her father died and shunned by society, Ophelia is living in poverty in a small, rundown cottage, caring for her dying mother. Her zest for life and her dreams of becoming an artist have slowly faded beneath the pain and sorrow of losing the person she loves most in the world.{A soft smile played at her lips, one that bore all too much knowledge. No crushed flower was this woman. In that smile, in her withering gaze was an understanding of the world not many ever obtained.}For me, Lady Darlington is the linchpin of the story. She loves her daughter and wants only her happiness. She recognises the goodness in Andrew and knows he is perfect for her daughter. She gives him the mother&#8217;s love that he has never had.Even within the constraints of this novella. Ms Claremont infuses her writing with such emotional depth. Ophelia and Andrew ceased to be simply characters on a page and became people I really cared about. Their journey was my journey. Their hopes and fears, their joy and tears were my hopes and fears, my joy and tears. It&#8217;s difficult for me to convey in words just how beautiful and poignant this story is and so here are some moments in the book that touched my heart.{In his eyes for one brief, holy moment, the world spun in a different direction, touched by beauty, touched by hope, touched by a strange sort of wonder.}{To his absolute chagrin, to his utter perversity, he was overwhelmed with a dancing, boyish glee.She&#8217;d come.}{And so Andrew faced the piano with the mother of his heart, a little boy who finally knew he was loved, and was suddenly aware of how wonderful life could be.}{And suddenly she was struck by an alarming realization. He was her other self. Her wild soul.}{&#8220;&#8230;I have lost my heart to you, piece by piece. Your strength, your kindness, your passion for life, they have all awakened what I had been so sure was dead. My soul. You have awakened my soul, Ophelia, because you are my other half. The joy to my cynicism. The passion to my jaded nature. You have taught me to live with hope again.&#8221;}Oh yes, Andrew&#8217;s friend, the mysterious Marquis of Vane&#8230;.what secrets is he keeping?  He promises to be an intriguing hero!{Once, Vane had been the most mischievous, the most boisterous, and the first to laugh of their school set. Now? The man looked as if he might be suited for the position of undertaker. No. Not undertaker. . . executioner.}Lady Wild is a unique and beautifully written story that is both heart-breaking and uplifting.

Liam likes Sebastian, but Liam is also a stickler for rules, and one of those rules is, don&#8217;t get involved with the boss. He sticks to this belief almost until the bitter end.Sebastian Haley appreciates all the help Liam gives him, but has never looked at Liam in a romantic way. When he&#8217;s offered a chance to appear on a gay reality show to find a partner he goes for it. Part of the reason is that he believes it is good publicity for a new dating app that his company is producing. The other is he really is looking for a partner.Liam and Sebastian become more closely involved with each other during his time making the show. And as the contestants are voted off, Sebastian realizes that he&#8217;s comparing all the men to Liam. Liam&#8217;s feelings for Sebastian increase during this time, but he&#8217;s sticking to his guns on not dating the boss.I knew how this story would end, but I was curious how the author would go about solving the problem. I liked the little twist that happened to make everyone get their HEA.A few times Sebastian seemed insecure and he let Liam take the lead in making decisions related to their relationship. Sometimes the scenes between them, when not focused on the show or work, seemed like teenagers muddling their way through a relationship. At the end we find that Liam likes being dominated, and following orders, and that might have worked in Sebastian&#8217;s favor if he had pushed the point of them dating during the show.The part where I had the most trouble with the story was the ending sex scene. I can only describe it as &#8216;Harlequin Romance.&#8217; It was like the author was describing a romanticized version of a sex scene between a guy and a girl where Liam, sounded like the girl. Even the actions were almost an idealized wedding night between a guy and a virgin girl. I had a hard time trying not to skim read through the sex scene. I also didn&#8217;t feel the connection between Liam and Sebastian that had been building throughout the whole story. The sex and the ending were a disappointment for me.I enjoyed this story quite a bit. It was sweet with not much angst. It might be a little on the slow side for some people, but I liked the gradual build-up of Liam and Sebastian&#8217;s relationship and how Sebastian came to realize that Liam was the one for him. The writing was smooth, easy to read, and I didn&#8217;t find many errors. The sex scene was the only part of the story that I didn&#8217;t enjoy, and it could just be a matter of personal preference but may appeal to others.

There's an abundance of well illustrated scenes that really make you feel like you are right there in the story, and that's something I really look for in a good book.Although it's a story that you may not want to get personally attached to, the author displays an ability to allow the reader just to observe also. It really is a moving read that stirs the heart.The story had every element a good story should have. An exciting plot, attention to detail, but best of all fleshed out, well-written and well-rounded character development. This interesting and compelling work, as I said, had my attention from the start and there are twists and turns in this page turner that will take the reader on a compelling and emotional journey! Also, the writing style is friendly and straightforward which makes for an enjoyable read.It's one of those stories that come along once in awhile that makes you want to read it non-stop until you get to the end. I'm giving nothing further away here. And this, I hope, will only add to the mystery and enjoyment for the reader!I'll certainly be looking forward to reading more from Smadar Shir in the future!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Powerful and Emotional Read", "unixReviewTime": 1401235200, "reviewTime": "05 28, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A1MB37O19KZ7KF", "asin": "B00KCX47VI", "reviewerName": "Linda C.

I just couldn't put it down,  T.L. Smith has created a female character who can stand up to the alpha males and make them kneel at her feet!The lead character is Krinos, a beautiful but tough Aussie who is a spitfire, she can hold her own, is confident in her sexuality, and not afraid to scratch that itch when she wants.  She's everything you would expect a drug bosses daughter to be, and the business is being handed over to her, which leads us to where she meets her fathers second in command, Stefanos.Stefanos is the Alpha of all Alpha male's, he is hot, sexy and used to getting what he wants when he wants... possessive of what he thinks is his... And he wants Krinos!When they meet, Krinos is in lust at first sight, she's not daft to pass up getting hot and heavy with this Greek God, but on her own terms...  Which Stefanos is not happy about, this leads to some awesomely hot reading... The sex is off the charts, hot heavy and hard.Krinos doesn't want to submit and neither will Stefanos and he has a hard time dealing with the fact that she is her own boss, not to be owned or submit (YAY) at last a female who is an equal to these alpha characters.  I also liked how she didn't weaken when times were at there worst, she is a fighter, and she will take on anyone who dares to think she is just a simpering woman.The story is fast paced, the drug world do not think a woman should be a boss, and they stupidly think that she will lay down and take their insolence, I really enjoyed reading this Novella, and I look forward to reading how she will take hold of both the reins in business and how she decides what future Stefanos will have in her life.T.K.

She also makes you care about her characters &#8211; even the crazy labradoodle. We know Fiona has some work to do.

Thankfully, it&#8217;s not as dire a situation as he was expecting but what he realizes is that Nathan is much more broken than anyone ever believed. With the urge to not only heal Nathan but to protect him, Dan makes it his mission to give the little omega some TLC. Unfortunately, things are a little more difficult than that when a new threat comes to town that&#8217;s looking to hit them where they&#8217;re most vulnerable&#8230; with Nathan. Can Dan give Nathan what he needs and save him from his past or will trying to save Nathan prove to be a useless attempt?This book just about broke my heart! I loved the way that it showed how Dan was a little miffed about not being picked as alpha but that we also got to experience why he was never selected as alpha and his understanding that he was never ready for that. I also loved seeing the change in Dan from the aloof beta to a more caring and reliable beta. Nathan was such a damaged character and he really made my heart clench with why he was so damaged but it was adorable the way he wormed his way into Dan&#8217;s heart. The relationship between them starts off tense, especially when you consider how Nathan was in Accidental Alpha and Dan&#8217;s opinion of him but then it slowly turns into one where they&#8217;re not only comfortable with one another but they crave to be around each other and reach for the other when the situation calls for it. I just adored them together.My only little niggle with this one was that it was too short! I really wished it had been longer because I&#8217;d love to have seen more of Nathan and Dan actually together as mates and to experience more of that connection that they were developing. Beyond that, I would have loved to see more of Nathan learning and exploring what it means to be a wolf and how Dan helps him with that.All in all, this was a fabulous addition to the Pack Partners series.

Please be advised an object is also used. It is horrific. And no, I won&#8217;t describe it now.Holly Mercer has had more than her share of bad luck. But most of it has been brought on by her always giving too much of herself and never standing up for herself or making herself a priority. Time after time she has done this and now the cows have come home. She&#8217;s 26 and has to move in with her parents and just got a job at the Fort Bragg High School as a secretary. The principal is the kind that doesn&#8217;t want to have to tackle the &#8220;hard kids&#8221; or do any of his own dirty work, so he assigns those kids to other people. Oh, and that definitely means the MC kids.Sterling &#8220;Knuckles&#8221; Grady is the Sargent at Arms for the Forsaken MC and father to a teenage daughter, Cheyenne. Recently Cheyenne&#8217;s attendance and grades have slipped because her dad is occupied with the club troubles and losing his best friend Chief (from book 1 when Alex was kidnapped by her brother.) Grady definitely doesn&#8217;t want to have to deal with someone from the school and doesn&#8217;t need to be told how to raise his daughter.Of course, since it is Holly&#8217;s job to contact the parents of the students under her directive, she has several run ins with Grady. To say that they are combustible is an understatement. Anytime they speak to one another, it turns into an insult hurling argument. Even though they drive each other crazy, they areAfter some &#8220;club business&#8221; goes down, Grady protects Holly, and they enter into somewhat of a faux relationship. But that doesn&#8217;t mean that they spend any time with each other cultivating appearances for this faux relationship, it is alive in words only.The mafia problem comes back to town and causes some issues since the club is still holding Michael Jr. and Alex is with Ryan. We don&#8217;t see how any dispute is solved and it remains to be seen whether or not it actually is, but I&#8217;ll bet is that we&#8217;ll continue to see this plot in upcoming books. Also, the Darren Jennings retribution against the club issue comes back into play. Again, there are no conclusions to that problem, only clues, so we&#8217;ll see that later.I didn&#8217;t like the timeline of this book. We never knew how far apart things happened until a couple pages into a new chapter, so parts of the book didn&#8217;t flow & just jumped around. Like the characters knowing that the other loves them & they love the other. There was no, scene there or how it happened, it was just mentioned.The epilogue takes us 2 years out, but with the next book being Jeremy & Cheyenne&#8217;s, I&#8217;m not sure if we&#8217;ll see the mafia/Jennings issues or if the book will proceed from this epilogue.

This is the story of Grady and Holly. Grady is the Sergeant of Arms in Forsaken motorcycle club and Holly has just moved back to Fort Bragg. As a reader, you know she has a bit of a sketchy past, but all is not revealed. She is trying to get her feet back on the ground and start anew, when all hell breaks loose and she is thrown into the crossfire with Forsaken. She seems to be filled with conflicting emotions. She wants to do right and be good, yet her morality is tested in very extreme situations. Such as mobsters accosting her outside of her job. Being kidnapped, albeit in the nicest possible way and left dangling off a seawall. You know, crazy stuff like that!Grady is trying to balance being a father to a seventeen year old girl, the death of his best friend, Chief, and all the grief that comes with that, and this newfound attraction to the smartass that is trying to get his daughter to graduate high school, Holly. He has the mob coming at him in one direction and keeps getting railroaded by Holly and her sassiness. He fights it for awhile, but finally succumbs to his affection for her. This eventually turns into so much more. They balance each other out. He needs someone at home that will soothe him during dark times, and she needs to know that her instincts about right and wrong are jaded and that&#8217;s ok. Grady understands, and that is everything to her.I love how this series picks up where the previous story left off and gives you background information from a different point of view. All three leading men, Ryan, Duke, and Grady have all been presented as real badasses. They are strong and strict and very rough around the edges. Grady is older and wiser. He knows what he wants in a woman and Holly is the one for him; plain and simple. This series just keeps getting better and better and I can&#8217;t wait for more! Hopefully Ian is up next.

This series has become on of my favorites.Holly just moved back into town and has a job at the high school as a secretary.  She is given the job of trying to get a students father to sign a form so Chey, the student, will be able to make up missed school work.  Holly has no clue who this man is, or what type of father he is.  She has made numerous attempts to get a hold of him, and nothing.  She is just trying to help Chey, so she can graduate.Grady, is in the Forsaken MC, he is also Chey's father.  He has just lost his best friend and is going through a lot.

What he didn't bargain for was Eric, a man who is willing to support Kelly and her writing and will stop a nothing to have her.The erotic parts of this story were well written and well balanced by the drama scenes sprinkled throughout.  However, the main drama revolving around the family felt a bit forced and out of place at times.  I say this because the fulfilling nuggets of drama between Nicky (the daughter) and Kelly were so wonderfully written and I would have almost trades some of the crazy sex scenes for more family interactions, I just wanted more.The best aspect of this book, all the POV chapters.  Most were from Kelly, but some sections were from Tom, a few from Eric, and some were flashbacks reinforcing Tom/Kelly's relationship starting with day one.

She love poetry, dogs, her family and the idea of being a serious relationship with a man who not only likes everything she does but is committed to her, someone she could see having a future with. She doesn&#8217;t swear and she likes her sex neat and clean&#8230;or so she thought. After her sister goes through a rough divorce from a cheating husband Jamie puts up walls to guard herself from it ever happening to her. But what she doesn&#8217;t expect is for the one man she should want to be the only man she can think about.Smith Grayson is a volunteer fireman who just so happens to own his own construction company, be one of Jamie&#8217;s friends and be working on the bar that Jamie works at. He is everything every woman could ever want, which is dangerous and a no go for Jamie. If every woman could want him then why would he just want her?After asking Jamie to dance in the back of the bar during a kickoff party Jamie finds herself unable to turn Smith down. He is everything she doesn&#8217;t want in a relationship but she can&#8217;t help her mind from wondering. And one night with him should be enough&#8230; right?But his crudeness, his dirty talking, and his rough hands on her body is all she can find herself thinking about. However a serious relationship isn&#8217;t in the cards. Smith is a love em&#8217; and leave em&#8217; type. Not really caring too much for committed relationships he opts out at the first chance he can take.  So Afraid to ruin their friendship, Jamie comes up with the idea to have a one week no strings attached fling&#8230; that should get him out of her prestigious panties.Unless Smith has other ideas&#8230;This story was insanely amazing! I fell for Smith instantly. The story while being told in a third person narrative point of view does an amazing job at getting in both of their heads so you see what they go through, how they evolve, and exactly what they are thinking at all times. I loved it even though there were a few moments I wanted to scream at my kindle. This is a novella that feels like so much more! Having an amazing HEA this book leaves you feeling fulfilled and satisfied by the end.Lauren does an incredible job at introducing the characters and getting you to not only like the them but making you feel for them right from the start and oh my gosh can she write some HOT sex. Never to be one to disappoint Lauren is true to form with the way she can write it.

He was selfish and manipulative and wasn&#8217;t a great friend to Gabe. With his story in Recovery comes the clarity of what he has been through, what has set him off on his path of destruction and what eventually leads him to become a better person.His home life growing up has failed him completely and it is probably only thanks to Gabes father and family that he kept himself together as long as he did. There was the accident that altered the course of Gabes sisters life that was the beginning of his path of self destruction. His sense of failure in himself leads to drinking, not just the odd one, but enough that it becomes his crutch and his only way of making it through the day.Alcohol can change you in the most shocking way. In Jamie it leads to a recklessness that ends up with him being raped. Too scared and ashamed to admit what has happened to him he turns even more to the alcohol that makes his existence palpable. It&#8217;s a never ending spiral of destruction that can only stop when Jamie takes ownership.The Bailey family were his salvation in more ways than one. Alec, a recovering alcoholic, becomes a mentor to Jamie and his AA sponsor. His wife Belle becomes more of a mother to Jamie than his own ever was. He is shown love and compassion for perhaps the first time in his life. He also grows up a lot and realises, maybe without even knowing, that he doesn&#8217;t want to let his new family down. With that thought he can take each day as it comes.This is a complex story and it feels almost as though the romance is just in the background. He meets Daniel at a critical time. Daniel is divorced and much older but very quickly becomes a friend and someone that Jamie can rely and lean on. Jamie has a fear of relationships only ever bothering with one night stands so it is lucky that Daniel is calm and patient.Being an alcoholic is in no way easy for anyone. Add to that the pressure of someone you love and respect dying, a man who has been your mentor falling apart in front of your eyes, their son hating your very existence and an older man trying to make your life as easy as possible and it is only with great fortitude that Jamie manages to get out of bed in the morning. Every hour is fraught with the possibility that having a drink would make life much easier.  This is when you realise that Jamie is much stronger than he thinks he is. He finds an inner strength that has him coping and fulfilling Belles dying wishes and also falling in love.This book is very different from the first one. The writing is heartfelt, heart wrenching and leaves you wrung out. A lot of things happen that would make a lesser man cave but Jamie proves to himself and those who love him that he is strong and more than capable. Quiet and loving Daniel is a true rock for the younger man even if their romance has to take a back to seat to everything else going on. A great and very different addition to the Salvage Series.

This is easily one of my favorite books of 2014. When we met Caleb in Changing Course, he goes through such unfathomable pain when he lost Manda. The circumstances surrounding her death are mysterious at best, and Caleb has been trying to solve the case of who was really driving the night Manda died. He's convinced it was her best friend, Sarah, and he's been trying to prove it for 5 long years.Caleb truly goes through all 7 stages of grief in this book. Especially when Sarah's sister comes into the picture. Emma turns Caleb's life upside down. She's related to the woman he's trying to ruin, yet their chemistry is undeniable. They can't stay away from each other, but Sarah will always remain between them.Emma is hilarious, kind, thoughtful, and all around a wonderful woman. She understands Caleb's grief, but she doesn't put up with his crap either. I did a mental fist pump every time Emma knocked Caleb on his as$ by never putting up with his bull. Emma definitely proved she isn't a weakling, but she doesn't let her pride get in the way either. I love a heroine who stands up for herself, but isn't domineering.It's hard for Caleb to move on when he thought he would never fall for another woman again. Emma's compassion and understanding for everything Caleb has gone through astounded me. Caleb is a sexy alpha male, but not in a macho way. He is the perfect blend of protector, lover, and friend. He loves with everything he has, but he can't let go of the past-at least not yet. Emma and Caleb agree to keep Sarah separate from their relationship, but Emma's heart is being pulled in opposite directions. Both of them go through a heartbreaking journey in their own way.Stolen Course can be read as a standalone, but to fully understand the circumstances behind Manda's death, I highly recommend reading Changing Course first. Brett and Jesse's story is just as emotionally charged as Caleb and Emma's.

Jennings and I have to say they were right, this book is awesome!Taint is written in Justice Drake&#8217;s point of view. You read that right MALE POINT OF VIEW! I loved his inner monologues and all the lies that he told himself throughout this book. Being inside Justice&#8217;s head made this book hilarious.This doesn&#8217;t mean that I loved Justice at all times though. He does something in the beginning of this book that I was so mad and sad about. I like when the hero falls on his ass chasing the girl. The hero shouldn&#8217;t even be able to think about another woman he&#8217;s so wrapped up in our heroine. In the end Justice did make me fall in love with him. He had a nice mushy side once he was willing to accept his feelings.Plus honestly, did you see that cover? Scroll up and go look. Do you see that smirk? Hot, isn&#8217;t it? Yeah, I know. I was picturing that slight smirk while reading, it helped me get over his dumb moves earlier in the book.  I want to print that cover image off, pin it to my cork board above my computer and just stare at it all day. Heck I need a signed copy in paperback just so I can set it on my nightstandOur heroine Allison was ok. I don&#8217;t have many notes on her, which is actually a good thing. It means she didn&#8217;t spend half the story ticking me off like so many other heroines out there. Allison is in a tough position, but I thought she handled it with grace and to the best of her ability.There is a big twist in Taint, that I am not going to talk about, but I&#8217;ll just say it did not see that coming at all. It comes out of left field, but I loved it. It adds just that little bit of drama to the story to really make things sizzle.  Plus the lobster stuff.. swoon. Really you just have to read the book to know what I&#8217;m talking about and it&#8217;s worth it to find out, trust me.Okay, let&#8217;s talk the sex. That&#8217;s the important part right? First let me say for you tug scene lovers out there, we get two from Justice. Overall the sex was pretty hot, but I had a problem with some of the initial scenes. You see, I get protective of my heroes and I only want them with &#8220;the girl&#8221;. I don&#8217;t want to read about them and another girl whether it be present or past tense. I don&#8217;t want to know about past conquest, especially not in any kind of detail.  It takes a while before we get any hot scenes between our two main characters. Once they do, it&#8217;s worth it because the two of them together is HOT. I just wish we could have had those scenes earlier in the story.Ultimately, that is what kept this book from a full five star rating for me. It takes SOOOOO long for the couple to get together. Taint has a very original storyline which drew me in but after a while I felt like it was dragging on because I just wanted them to finally hook the freak up.I wish there had been an epilogue so we could really see Justice and Allison as an official couple, more than we were able to in what was provided.

I wanted her to die a slow and painful death after she was humiliated through Ellsberg (yes I know I can hold a grudge in books) I honestly never though Ms. Hunter could make me not want Bailey gone I never dreamed in a million years that Bijou would make me like and dare I say love Bailey. and want to read a book about her *gasp* But Ms. Hunter started to prove me oh so wrong and do he impossible, Bijou Hunter did the unthinkable and made me like Bailey and then love Bailey and look forward to her in the books and then she made me ecstatic for Bailey's book and now I am all on the Bailey fawn bus.Nick was always a no brainer for me he was sweet and then the more I got to know him through books the more I saw there was a lot we weren't seeing and when I heard he was Baileys hero I was on pins and needles to see how their story would play out. Bailey has had a good life more than a good life, everything Bailey wanted she got including a great family, With the help of friends and her brothers significant others Bailey has worked hard at becoming a better person who she likes and through this process Bailey has gained friendships that she never dreamed she would have. The only thing missing in Bailey's life is Nick.Bailey was devastated when she realized Nick was into Farah so Bailey did what she does best and acted out, and even though Bailey has went through a lot of changes wanting Nick for her own will never change. Frustrated that Nick never seems to notice her Bailey makes herself known and loudly. Nick grew up completely different than Bailey so when he could leave Nick never looked back. Now fighting in the Thunderdome Nick is finally able to afford college and things he never had growing up but what wants most of all is Bailey. Even though Nick knew Bailey was too good for him Bailey has always been it for him so when Bailey puts herself out there and makes it obvious that she wants him Nick finally makes his move.As Nick and Bailey start a relationship it isn't easy for Nick, the things done to him as a child have made having a relationship hard but Bailey is more stubborn than his past and she isn't willing to give him up no matter what. As Bailey and Nick begin to fall in love the past comes back in different forms to try and separate the two. Now Nick and Bailey will have to decide if they will fight for the one thing they each always wanted.I loved this book it was such and easy read, I picked this book up and I was instantly taken back to Ellsberg. Bailey is once again hilarious in this book I literally laughed on the first page and continued laughing through out this book. I also loved seeing Bailey's growth in this book she isn't just a shallow rich girl she loves Nick and her family and friends and she loves them all deeply. Like I said earlier Nick was easy for me I loved him from the beginning and knew I would just fall more in love when I read his book but Nick wasn't just easy he suffered a lot growing up and that shaped him and made him who he was. There is so much to Nick that we get to see in this book and my heart broke for him and all that he went through but we also( and maybe the best part) get to see Nick push past his upbringing so that he could be the man Bailey deserved and the man he deserved.We get to see all the great characters from the past books and we get great follow ups on them all as well. I must say that the epilogues were fantastic in this book, they weren't super long but they were written so well that I never felt like we were missing anything they were the perfect ending to a great book and even better love story . I cried while reading them and it just made me even more sad to have to finish this book. Bijou Hunter is a great author who can not only make me cry but make me laugh, and fall in love, and also make me feel like the charters she has created are real people that I know and love.This is one of those series that never can quite leave your thoughts. Though I read A LOT this is one of those series that I find myself either thinking about or check on to see when the next book comes out( fine some might call it stalking) or even wanting to re-read. Now I just have to wait for more from this series (oh the struggles I have to endure). I can't wait for the rest of this series.

Adams. This is another short read and is only about 170 pages long. This New Adult read starts when Kayla is dumped by her boyfriend just a few weeks before her college graduation. Suddenly alone with all her plans shattered, Kayla turns to her sexy neighbor Jake when she comes across him in a bar one night. They had previously hooked up, and it took her months to get over him the first time. She decides to have fun with him for the night. But when her apartment gets set on fire, she and Jake are left with the only option of becoming roommates in another apartment building. Kayla's friends make an agreement with Jake that they will cover part of his portion of the rent if he will help give Kayla some fun. But soon their passion and feelings are more than just him helping to loosen her up a bit. Can they turn the fun and sex into a real relationship?I liked Jake. He was sexy and sweet, and I loved that he was a firefighter. He was so particular when it came to everything being done correctly and about fire hazards, it was pretty cute. I liked that he was always open and honest about his feelings with Kayla. He was fun and brought out a whole different side to her. I liked them together a lot. Kayla was a bit uptight and she was scared to let anyone in. Even when Jake was being open with her and telling her how he felt, she would pick a fight or try to run. But I thought that they had a lot of chemistry together and were really hot. I liked seeing them figure things out between them and start a relationship together.Overall, this was a short and fun read. Even though the characters had known each other for awhile, they weren't close and I felt like their relationship was rushed. It was a bit too insta-love to me considering Jake's transformation from player to serious boyfriend happened so quickly. I just felt like I had missed a huge portion of his transformation, and it didn't make sense that he would change so quickly even with his developing feelings for Kayla. I thought that there should have been more time from the start of things to the point where he is telling her he loves her. It was surprising to me to see him be the one admitting his feelings and wanting a commitment though. Usually it is the girl and the guy fights it, so that was interesting to see. I would recommend this story if you are looking for something quick and sexy that is fun and enjoyable. If you are looking for a deep connection though, I am not sure this one is for you. I did like the characters though, and will look for more from Allie K. Adams in the future.**Complimentary Copy Provided by Tasty Book Tours**", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Short and Fun read.

And when he meets Iris he immediately thinks she is way too young for him, but he can't but be attracted to her. And Iris is a bit of mystery not only to Alasdair but to the reader as well... And now we just have to wait and see how Alasdair will handle his young Iris..This was a very short story that seemed to end rather abruptly.

I hate how I can't seem to figure her out, and apparently neither can the hero of the story.

He never shuts up, he has a heart of gold, and he's had a major crush on Michael since they first met. In Simon's interview, no less, where Simon was imagining all kinds of wicked things he'd like to do to and with the hot, older lieutenant. Needless to say, I was pretty sure 'Fused By Fire' was going to be a hot, sweaty, sexy, steamy, and good read. I wasn't wrong. Since I've already expressed my sincere appreciation for first responder jobs, and firemen in particular, I don't need to say much more than &#34;dayum&#34;.Simon thought that by transferring from the firehouse to an EMT unit, his crush on Michael would fade away. No such luck. What's that saying about distance and the heart? Michael, on the other hand, feels like a lecherous old man for even thinking of Simon in that manner. Michael is sixteen years older and, in his mind, that's way too big of an age gap. For all that Simon is an out gay man, he's got very little actual experience and since his parents disowned him a month ago for coming out, Simon is feeling very lost and lonely these days.When one of his firefighters gets seriously injured at a fire, Michael blames himself, even though he pulled the guy out and saved his life. Michael takes a leave of absence to figure out how he can continue to command and Simon storming the castle walls of Michael's stubbornness throws them both into a conflagration of lust. And, yeah&#8230;it's good, really, really good! But, what next?This was a wonderful addition to the series, and, in fact, Simon and Michael might just be my favorite couple so far.

It introduces us to a world of magic, necromancers, zombies, ghosts, and more and contains a heady and combustible mix of smokin&#8217; hot romance and scenes of horror. It is without doubt one of my top reads of 2014.I ADORED the hero Bastian, a tortured alpha hottie who is immediately drawn to Morgan, the heroine. He wants to protect her, not only from his father Ronan, but also from himself as he believes that he is not worthy of a woman&#8217;s love. Morgan&#8217;s own life has not been easy as she has struggled to cope with her ability to see spirits and has been grossly misunderstood. She is shocked to realise that she is a powerful necromancer and despite her independence welcomes Bastian&#8217;s help in protecting her from his father, who desires her for his own evil ends. I LOVED how Morgan&#8217;s powers grew throughout the novel and how the couple united in battling Ronan.Ronan is a formidable adversary and will stop at nothing to achieve his ends, including his evil sorcerer&#8217;s magic. Can Bastian open his heart to trust a female necromancer whose own magic could enslave him just as his father&#8217;s had?The lovemaking scenes between Bastian and Morgan are sublime &#8211; graphic, scorching hot and emotionally intense and left me in no doubt that the couple are destined to be together. These scenes contrast with the bloody and visceral scenes of horror and violence which illustrate the evil that is Ronan, Bastian&#8217;s father.The enduring bond between the three brothers, Bastian, Rory and Nathan, who had shared so much pain and abuse in the past was also a feature of the read which I enjoyed.  Although this book focuses on Bastian we are afforded an insight into what makes his equally tortured and hot siblings tick and I seriously hope that Madeline Pryce will be penning their own books soon!The pacing of the book and the balance between the scenes of magic and action and horror with the romance and lovemaking scenes were perfect.

Being an owner of several dogs (and 14 cats--who we used to feed puppy food because it's much cheaper than cat food) I found it appalling what manufacturers put in the pet food. Pet food can be convenient, especially if you have a lot of pets in your care since you won't have time to prepare food for them all. But after reading this book, it's not worth it.  have seen first hand the side effects of eating pet food as the pets grow older.As I read the book, I found it unethical how the pet food companies keep what they're doing secret--it's all about money, and even the Vet's can't stand up against it because that's where their research money comes from. To give you an idea what you're feeding your pets, and what's the difference and why it's such a big deal, the difference is that much of pet food is from animals who died of disease or it's meat that's already spoiled (as opposed to animals who were only recently slaughtered). That means the meat still contains the disease. it's food that's unfit for human consumption--i.e. livestock that died due to disease, you would normally not feed this to humans because it's dirty, so rather than the farmers losing income they can kind of recycle that and at least make some money out of it. It also includes euthanized cats and dogs from animal shelters and vet offices, road kill, and wastes from slaughterhouses, dead animals from farmers. That's why cat food is much cheaper.  But the good news is, you can feed your pets without spending so much. The author provides 40 recipes you can use to feed your pets.If you love your pets, you may want to read this book, it's explained in a simple and easy to understand manner and you can finish it in one sitting.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "No More Pet Food!

Deciding it was time to confront the enigmatic Shannon Morgan face to face, he goes to her office. The woman he finds there is anything but what he expected and now he can&#8217;t seem to take his eyes or his mind off her, and wants only to impress and win her over &#8211; completely.Shannon Morgan is nearly at the end of her rope, between her boss who is determined to get her fired and the artist who was awarded a commission by the city to do a glass art display for the Fourth of July celebration, she&#8217;s ready to go crazy. Then to make matters worse, her occasional father and her ex-boyfriend have decided to, now of all times, show up and make her life even more complicated.

Whether it&#8217;s his determination to present his art the way he sees it at its most creative, or his determination to win over the beautiful Shannon who he fears thinks of him only as a friend even though when they&#8217;re together, they make sparks that rival his vision for his glass fireworks display. As usual, Peggy does a fabulous job of conjuring the most wonderful hero to make us fall in love right along with the heroine.When Shannon&#8217;s on again, off again father makes a play for winning over his daughter and pushes Shannon&#8217;s ex-boyfriend on her, Leo and his art get tangled up in a situation which might do more than cause a split between he and Shannon. As usual, Peggy handles the emotions and interference of others in a realistic, logical fashion, which keeps the reader turning the pages eager to find out what the not-so-nice guys are really up to, while cheering on Leo in the hopes he gets his girl. SPARKED BY LOVE: A Holiday Romance by Peggy Bird is a wonderful story about a woman who doesn&#8217;t trust falling in love, and a man who teaches her falling in love is wonderful, and can end in truly spectacular fireworks of the best kind.I highly recommend SPARKED BY LOVE: A Holiday Romance by Peggy Bird because it&#8217;s the most smile-worthy story you can read over any weekend - holiday or not.***eARC provided by author in exchange for an honest and unscripted review.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "4 1/2 stars for this delightfully romantic story filled with loads of sparks.

It flows that nicely and is that good.When Abigail's mother is dying in the hospital her Guardian Angel, Cillian (Ian) chooses to 'fall' by becoming human. Much like City of Angels. Of course he does this against the advice of his fellow Guardian and best friend, Rolfius. As Ian and Abby get to know one another, secrets and messages from Abby and Ian alike come into play, in addition to Abigail's best friend, Maureen. This one is a little spit fire! I feel like Maureen should've been the redhead as opposed to Abigail who is too quiet and scared for my liking. She's too much in a shell and open to vulnerability, BUT her mom did just die a week ago so I'll give her a pass...She does drink an excessive amount, though. All Abigail seems to do is get drunk, but in hindsight I can see why. Some people think alcohol solves your problems. It doesn't; it makes them worse. Also, some people who are highly 'sensitive' (to vibrations, energy, etc) try to cover it up...make it go away...if you're drunk, you can't feel, hear, or sense anything. I totally get that. More than I care to admit.Maureen however, is a put up with no b.s kind of gal - my type! ;) As she comes to term with the fact that she can see 'the other side' she takes it quite well. I know there are people who are more &#34;sensitive&#34; to vibrations and such (as we're all actually meant to be) so this isn't unreasonable. If you open yourself up to the metaphysical world, you'll see your physical one start to change...Unfortunately, once someone &#34;wakes up&#34; they not only open themselves to the good, but to the bad also. That's the balance. One must learn to filter out the energy and that's what Abby and Maureen must do.I do like that Rolfius and Maureen are starting to....let's say &#34;meet half way&#34; and I'm super excited for the next book b/c it focuses on Maureen!I only gave it 4.5 instead of 5 b/c I feel it fell juuuuuuuust a bit short of some plot holes being closed up. I also was a bit unsure of Rolfius &#34;conjuring&#34; things for everyone. Wasn't the point of Cillian's fall to become human to live...like a human and discover how difficult it really is? Problems, therefore, were solved just a bit too quickly for me and people were just a hair too accepting of certain things, but it wasn't so bad as to bring the rating down further.I felt Cillian was just a tad too naive in the beginning, but I do like that became a bit more sure of himself and stronger.Rolfius, I love his sense of humor! He's a sweetheart who doesn't rely solely on sarcasm to get a point across. He's funny about it as opposed to being a jerk. There is also a funny part where Cillian tries coffee for the first time and it make me LOL. Literally!

Benedict always intrigued me and now he has his day. Sir Benedict Harper barely survived with Peninsular Wars, he came through it with nearly crushed legs and was told he would never walk again. With the aid of crutches he defies all reason by bringing shame to those skeptics. Walking does not mean that he is  not in consistent pain, but the pain of living is a far better choice than no life at all, I suppose.Through his older brother's death, Ben becomes the heir to his estate but leaves his younger brother in charge. His brother in a sense usurps Benedict's title and land, leaving him in limbo after his convalescence with the other Survivors. Deciding to travel instead of regain his home, Ben ends up at his favorite sibling's estate for a visit. That visit changes his life when he practically mows down a widow and her dog while riding a horse with some difficulty.Mrs. Samantha McKay is a widow at the age of twenty-three, when her husband succumbs to his injuries years after the war ends. While Samantha is not your typical grieving widow, he husband's family insist on deep mourning, which includes her spinster sister-in-law, Matilda guarding over her every move, making sure she wears the most awful of black mourning attire, keeps all the windows covered and sends all callers away. Samantha is growing excessively tired of the rigidity of her in-laws, especially with the fact that her sister-in-law reports back to her father on every move Samantha makes.At first Samantha finds Sir Benedict unpleasant, but after an apology for almost injuring the lady, they become friendly and Samantha has an outlet for her feelings. When Samantha decides she wants to go riding with Ben and his sister, Matilda forbids it, only to be overridden by Samantha. A shocked Matilda hightails it back to her father, who in turn sends his men to fetch Samantha back to his oppressive home and instruct his daughter-in-law on correct comportment of a widow. Instead of being bullied, Samantha escapes from England with Ben as her protector, but with a budding attraction to one another, one wonders of respectability with rule.Benedict's believing he has no right to love after being so crippled by his misfortune in the military and Samantha's insistence on being free after her one sided marriage to a man she thought she loved but fund quickly she was mistaken, fuels THE ESCAPE by Mary Balogh. Denial of a relationship by both parties only makes this story stronger as both Ben and Samantha come to terms with their lots in life. THE ESCAPE was everything I hoped it would be and more. Benedict needed a love who would never pity him his disability but see it as only adding to his persona and that is exactly what he finds with his Samantha. I highly recommend this book, as well as any in the Survivor's Club Series.

So glad I didn't. This book was absolutely not what I expected. I've read books in 1st person POV before, but as I read this one, I often forgot that it was a novel and felt like J.J. was talking to me and revealing his painful life story. There were many places where I felt I could relate to J.J. and my heart hurt for him even though there were times I felt like yelling at him that he should have known better. I felt like J.J. knew my past, knew I wouldn't judge, and knew his story was even worse...but with a similar ending. The pain and hurts we go through serve to make us stronger and better people.

You shouldn&#8217;t lose hope though, certain detoxes can be extremely beneficial for losing weight and general health and this guide offers an in depth look at one of the best options available.I think the main benefit of this particular detox is the speed of the results. 7 pounds in 7 days is significant for anyone. Whenever people start diets or detoxes they are always motivated but that determination often quickly evaporates so the fact that results can be seen so quickly following the program is a massive plus point. It means that anyone who follows it is more likely to complete it successfully instead of giving up.I really like the fact the book educates the reader on the known toxins present in many foods and drinks. For most people it will be a real eye opener and it helps to emphasize the need for detoxes. All the vital information on the 7 day plan is given such as the shopping list and an overview of the benefits meaning you can be sure you&#8217;re fully prepared before you begin.The author certainly has covered everything and the result is a comprehensive look at an extremely healthy detox plan.

When I got my hands on my copy I eagerly dived straight into it and was greeted with a familiarity that I had not realised you could miss so much from a book series. The vision of the world where the Order of The Black Swan lives and the likes of the adoring Animal House and rough housing Z Team were out nightly riding the world of vampires. A place where Lady Elora Laiken fell into in Book 1 and changed everything as that dimension and everyone within it, knew it.We start roughly just before where the last book ended with the death of the Sovereign of Jefferson Unit - Solomon Nemamiah and go back in time to what lead up to his untimely dimise. What happens next is a shock to say the least but I won't talk about that because I do not want to give anything away, reading it first hand yourself will give you so much more pleasure, trust me.  Sol's fianc&eacute;e Susan Farnsworth was left devastated by his death and had worked hard at trying to muddle through her life so far. Taking one day at a time and beginning to look to the future, Susan is stunned when the new Sovereign Rev Farthing  who is 13 years her junior, begins flirting with her she is stunned. A wonderful plot of love, honour and forever truly means whirls and twists it's way within the book around another important plot line.Dr. Mercy Renaux, we meet right at the beginning of the book, where she encounters the hot, impulsive, rough and ready Sir Rafael Nightsong. Unfortunately their personalities clash in a war of words and tempers leaving them both annoyed but imprinted upon each other that they find it almost impossible to get each other out of their heads. Neither thought they would see each other again but as luck would have it fate steps into play and Mercy is hired by The Order. Unbeknowns to them both Raif's latest order are to protect the newest and most important new member of The Order along with the rest of Z Team. The though of being pulled off patrol to end up &#34;baby sitting&#34; someone doesn't sit well with the team, that is until Mercy steps onto the plane and the games changes instantly. Raif feels like time has stopped but is frozen to the spot in the shock of seeing her there and that he is her new mission that he simply misses his chance to apologise for his horrendous behaviour towards her the day they met. Torn spotting Raif's reaction to Mercy and the fact that he is a ladies man has him instantly flirting with her mixing things up to a boiling cauldron that turns to a triangle of cat and mouse.  Never have two people wished to be somewhere else than where they currently are!I personally feel that this long awaited addition to the Black Swan Series was a very good novel and I did really enjoy it, but not as much as the other within the series previously as there are many questions left unanswered when it has been made clear another full novel in the series is not on the cards. So just why is one of the major plot line so carelessly overpowered by another plot line and then left unfinished when it could have added a whole new layer to the novel, making it even more exciting and then bringing it full circle within the case  to a neatly tucked up close? I have an exceptionally high opinion of Victoria Danann and I respect her as an author on one of the highest levels so I find it hard to understand just why she has chosen to go along with this oversight?

Niccolo returns to Italy after a 4 year absence. His father figured moving him back to Italy would set him on the right path but it wasn't the place as much as it was a person. Karina and Niccolo were childhood friends and he returns to find that she has grown into a beautiful woman with many responsibilities. A business she must keep afloat and a mother who lives with a temperamental disease. It seems it was perfect timing on Nic's part and thanks to his stubbornness or his love for the girl it changed not just his life but hers as well. Nic no longer wondering aimlessly through life has found happiness with the girl he loves and in a profession he is now making a very good living at. Which I think is all his father ever wanted for him to just have some direction and to learn to grow up. I wish I had a man who would fight to not just keep me in his life but protect my family at the same time. I love how all the childhood moments the will he or won't he came full circle. The moments on the bridge touch my heart (especially the ending). After all the betrayal and thoughts of not being good enough they finally found a home and a love in each other. What touched me most is the fact the her mother seems to be doing much better.

There is little angst in this story as it is more a story of how the ton did or did not accept Elizabeth into their circles and how Elizabeth managed through this process.

Have no fear, reader: there are no graphic details about bedroom scenes.  I was reminded, in reading about the Bingleys, of what Mr. Bennet stated after their engagement (in canon) was announced, \"...Your tempers are by no means unlike.  You are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so easy that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will always exceed your income.\"  Jane and Charles do learn to open up and speak out but the process is not without its bumps.The First Anniversary dinner for both couples and the later private nighttime celebration is heart warming...Darcy does not disappoint!  Lovely scene painted for us.Caroline Bingley and the Hursts maintain their snobbery and this, too, is FINALLY, addressed by the correct party.  Their further company in both sisters' houses comes to depend....well, you'll have to read the novella to learn that.

The difference in this newest book, however, is that now she has someone else who knows her true identity: Dornan&#8217;s youngest son Jace. The boy that she has always loved is now a man, and he must choose whether his allegiance is to his family, or to the girl he buried years before.Just like the three books before this, Four Score was a quick, dark and satisfying read. What I liked best about this installment, however, is that it focused less on the revenge aspect and more on the relationship between Jules and Jace. As childhood sweethearts in a less than hearts-and-flowers environment, it is interesting to watch their relationship develop, not only as adults, but under the circumstances that they are now faced with. Juliette continues to be the strong and determined heroine, but we are also given more insight into Jace and what he went through as the one who was left behind.Similar to last time, the only complaint I have about this series is the price and the serial nature.

Jase admitted what happened to him after Juliette's pretend funeral & my heart breaks for him. I'm sure he was tortured by his father for attempting to protect Juliette since Jase can't even talk about it, the memories are that bad. I would gladly have given this book five stars because all along we've been getting dirty details about Sammi & Dornan which was hot in a way & made me want to puke at the same time - how can she stomach being with him intimately after everything he's put her through? That is how strong her resolve is to take him down, to stay in character & see this through to the end. So why didn't we get lots of dirty details about Juliette & Jason's reunion that we've been dying for? I'm assuming it is because these two kids fell deeply in love & have still been in love even when Jase thought she was dead for the past six years. I still would have enjoyed a hotter reunion!

Now she&#8217;s just worried about what he is going to do that with information.Jules can finally be herself around Jase now that he knows who she really is, something she&#8217;s wanted since this whole thing started.

Jules has some questions of her own that need answered as well, but she may not like the information that&#8217;s provided in return.The love Jase has for Jules is amazing, you can see (almost feel) how much he cares for her in pretty much everything he does. He wishes she never had to do what she&#8217;s done to get her revenge, that is something he should have done years ago, but he did what he had to in order to survive.

HOW DID KARYN (the sister) hide her laptop in the false bottom of her boyfriend's chest?  Rylan stated they weren't lovers and she had broken up with him.  So she couldn't have had a key to his apartment.  If she brought it over how would she have put it in their without Rylan knowing she put it in there?  Last but not least the author did what irritates me. She threw in words typical people don't use a whole lot.. macie said,&#34; You deceived me&#34; when she found out it was rylan.

She lived with an emotionally and physically abusive father who targeted both her and her mother until a tragic night when, at the age of eight, she found herself thrust into a foster care system that placed her in homes that perpetuated and worsened the cycle of abuse. While not all of the placements were in unhealthy environments, the nice homes were overshadowed by an abusive court-appointed guardian who used his position of authority to force her into a sexual relationship. When the reader first meets Hadley, it is glaringly obvious that while she has survived the wretched situation of her life, she has not thrived. And while her first meeting with Miller was intense, the tampon incident made the scene feel real and made me chuckle. As much as Miller&#8217;s sexual intensity frightens her, it also draws her to him and seeing him is the highlight of her day &#8230; and has been for three years. Unbeknownst to Hadley, Miller is just as aware of her as she is of him, but he is a patient man who recognizes her wounded soul and knows he must tread lightly.When the author takes the story in a direction that enables Hadley to get to know Miller via letters and text messages, I was quite impressed. It was an original idea (at least one I have never encountered) and did not feel contrived considering who Miller is. As we learn throughout the book of all the little things that had to occur for their relationship to develop the way it did, I again felt the realism of the book. I will admit that I was surprised that the story occurred within the time frame of a year as there are so many things that Hadley had to endure and got to enjoy, that it felt longer time-wise. Because of the way their relationship developed, the reader is well into the book (close to 60%) before the two have sex. Readers with a sensitivity to sexual assault should proceed with caution as it is a topic in the book, but should also be aware that none of the sex scenes are described in a detailed or graphic nature.While I enjoyed reading Cut Too Deep and liked the characters immensely, something fell a bit flat and kept this from being a great read for me. It wasn&#8217;t until the final couple of chapters that I realized what it was &#8211; for me, the transition from the author&#8217;s narrative to the character&#8217;s dialogue and internal thoughts was not smooth. Did this interfere with the flow of the story? Occasionally. Did it make this a bad read? Absolutely Not! I enjoyed the book and look forward to reading more of Ms. Bell&#8217;s work.

It&#8217;s romantic and angsty. I just thought it was such a fantastic, quick read.In a nutshell, this is about what our minds (all mushy and romantic like we are) assume happens after someone wins an American Idol-esque television show. The shot to fame, the paparazzi, the crazy fans. But most importantly, it&#8217;s about the people who knew you before you became a superstar. How do you fit the girl you&#8217;ve loved since childhood into this crazy new world?I loved these characters. Noah wins a talent competition, and instantly, his life changes. He&#8217;s still the kind, sweet guy he was before underneath it all, but suddenly he has to try and deal with the entertainment business and all of its craziness. I never doubted his choices though. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s supposed to sort of make you believe he&#8217;s with this person or making questionable choices, but for me&#8230;he just never seemed like that sort of person. I felt like he was smart enough to not fall for the games others were trying to play. And then there&#8217;s Chloe. She has been his best friend since they were children. When she takes a job in New York and near Noah, assigned to run a blog that reports on him exclusively, she also sees the world Noah has been thrown in to. I love that they sort of have to conquer this new world together, even though every element is trying to tear them apart. They try to stay strong and remember who they were before it all. Although they were never &#8220;together&#8221; before, as a reader, you just NEEDED them to be together.Overall, I thought this was a very exciting, easy book to read. It was very sweet, humorous, and had just enough angst to make your tummy turn and heart race.

Honestly, I think that's a clever idea for a series. In Forever, we saw Rebecca and Zach reunite. Now it's Sarah's turn to find love in Finally. However, before she finds love she wants a fling and who better than to give her that than Zach's brother, Jeffrey. Plus, it's convenient. We all know by now that in romance stories, flings never workout the way the characters want.Let me just say that I sort of predicted Jeffrey's ex would pop in the story, but I wasn't expecting how she would return. The way she reappear in his life made me not like her. For a little bit of the story I didn't like Jeff, and part of the my reasoning is how he handle his ex. He acted like an idiot and he was lucky that Sarah was willing to listen to him, but it took some coaxing. Sarah is a sweet girl in the story and is afraid to give her whole heart to a guy that's not worth the chance. Yes, it stems from a broken relationship. I completely understand why she got bent out of shape when the ex return.I enjoyed the story and like how the story progresses from previous book. The story can be read as a stand alone, but would be better enjoyed as reading from the book one. I like how Miranda gives a hint at the end on whats going to happen in the next book. I have to say I can't wait for that story, because I have a feeling it will be a doozy.Basically Finally is a light read that has two people who started out with a fling, but progress to something more. Of course, you can't have a story with no conflict, so we have a return of an ex. Can there be a happy-ever-after for Jeff and Sarah?

I hate what happened to him but in the end all his physical wounds were healed. I like that this series isn't vampire focused or werewolf focused. I like that it is magic focused. It seems everything magical is in this series without it being overwhelming. I do not like that at the end everyone from Camelot was able to come to the future because if it was that easy then Lance should have been able to know his mother. I like that he was given someone to fill the hole he had because he wasn't going to be happy just being someone else's guard and that's it.  It was easy for me to get to know the characters and feel like they were real which is what I look for when reading.

After witnessing the murder of her father as a child; Cecilia embarks on a mission to solve his murder. The first thing she needs to do to work her plan is land an internship at Leighton Enterprises, a place well known for investigating crimes. She believes it holds the info she must obtain in order to connect the pieces of the crime. And ultimately catch a killer.Cecilia affectionately called Ceci, decides to assume her older sister&#8217;s identity because she herself is only a senior in high school. Ceci gets the internship just as she planned but what she did not plan is the strong attraction she feels toward the soon to be appointed CEO, Bentley Leighton.Bentley is far from happy with his new role working in the family run company and instead sees it as a means to an end that will eventually land in his favor. When the sassy, confidently beautiful Cecilia becomes his new weekend intern he quickly finds himself in very compromising position&#8230;between her legs.My ThoughtsThe Intern definitely surprised me. Ceci is witty, clever and irresistible. Brooke Cumberland has a great secondary plot going with the mystery surrounding the death of Cecilia&#8217;s father. For me there is nothing like a good murder mystery being thrown in to the mix of a romance to keep you on the edge of your seat. Cumberland also has that forbidden romance aspect which appealed to my taste buds as well.My RatingsCharacters- Clever, daring and inventiveWriting Style- GoodPlot/Storyline- A high school senior fakes her older sisters identity in order to get an internship that may hold leads to her father&#8217;s murdererSteam Factor- High/Steamy on a scale of 1-10 I say 7Entertainment Level- From Lo-Med-Hi I say MediumOverall- I enjoyed it!

Novella&#8217;s typically leave me wanting for more, but in the case of Yield to Me it was perfectly done.Marcy is a fighter. She is stubborn and has something to prove, which makes her determined to win. There is nothing she wouldn&#8217;t do in order to become the best female in the MMA &#8230; except accept the help from Jax the new trainer hired to get her ready for the upcoming fight.Jax is a retired MMA fighter, a psychologist, and he trains fighters to help them be their best. He was brought to Club Excelsior to help Marcy get over her fear of submission, but the stubborn little spitfire refuses him.Marcy and Jax have instant chemistry and something inside of Marcy craves everything Jax can offer. Will she let down her guard long enough to see what is right in front of her? Can Jax help Marcy accept who she really is and save her fighting career?I absolutely love fighter books and this is no exception. I can&#8217;t wait to read more in the series.

I was just a little disappointed as this book doesn't contain the level of excellence, character development, and depth as the first book.Army of the Dead starts with a bang, literally. A furious pace of motorbike chases, abductions, vicious fighting and numerous zombie attacks is set right from the start of the book. In fact, there is so much violence in this story that it stopped having the intended shock impact, and only became something I read to try and find a storyline. Brutally murdered children and exploding zombie heads became a sideline and ceased to be horrifying as I read on to see what would happen next to the few characters I actually cared about.Responsibility and marriage seem to have changed Xander. No longer the cute, smart mouthed kid of Rise of the Horde, he is now neurotic, jealous of any man who looks at Felicity Jane, and extremely stubborn. Fortunately he is also very responsible and will sacrifice himself to save others.I absolutely loved the new character, Sonya, who is introduced rather early in the book. A true warrior and excellent handler of animals, she contributes much to aiding Xander and Felicity Jane  with several escapes in the chaotic post Z-Day world. However, the fact that Sonya and Felicity Jane couldn&#8217;t get along and fought like cats even while they were in mortal peril, really got on my nerves.Despite the few negative points I mentioned, I still think Devan Sagliani created a wonderfully realistic end of the world scenario. A scary world where cannibalistic motorbike gangs and power hungry Hitler wannabes fight for dominance. A place which had become the perfect playground for crazy scientists. Is it a wonder then when some of these elements decide to raise a zombie army or create genetically engineered monsters for personal gain?During the course of this very fast-moving book, we visit an old western town where a community of actors try and survive, as well as Xanadu, a colony of people who strive for harmony and healing. Apart from all the action, suspense and violence, there are some lovely tender moments in the story.For readers who enjoy nonstop action and loads of violence, I recommend Army of the Dead as your ultimate adrenalin fix.

Sequels are often &#34;hit or miss&#34;, and I assumed this would be no different: the first book was so thrilling and action-packed, I was skeptical whether the authors would be able to keep the momentum.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that this book did pick up right where the first book left off.  It even flowed smoothly into the second book without pause.  If anything, this book actually read at a faster pace--something that can't often be said for a sequel.  There were so many twists and turns to keep me on my toes throughout this book.  Just when I thought I knew what was about to happen, another character would come along and make the story change direction.  This book, unlike the first one, had quite a few different points of view besides just those of Eve and Angel.  This really benefitted the story--it gave more depth and helped to keep the twists coming throughout the book.  This also created a better understanding of the characters' thoughts and feelings during their parts in the story.  I also learned so much more about each of their backgrounds and different personalities.  Unlike Severed Angel, this book did not end with a huge cliffhanger.  Nevertheless, the ending in this book is enough to satisfy you until the release of the next book.This story also introduces two brand new characters, one of whom turns out to be a main character.  You learn so much more about Ink, Cowboy, Disney, and Satan.  You also get to meet--and fall in love with--little Elizabeth.  You will definitely want to read this book, and if you haven't done it already...read Severed Angel (Severed MC, book 1).  You will not regret doing so because this series is freaking amazing.

However, if you do enjoy those types of reads like I do, then pull up a chair and let's chat because this book is definitely for you!Carnal Desire picks up EXACTLY where Severed Angel left off. Ava believes that she has outstayed her welcome with the Severed MC group, and abruptly flees home to England. However, little does she know that Angel's filthily evil twin brother, Satan, is hot on her trail and has not let up for a second in his determination of eliminating his one and only ever, stranded witness.Satan is a deliciously evil villain that I've been terrified of throughout this entire series. At times my heart broke for him because he has very clearly led a life devoid of any love at all. I kept wanting to find a tiny sliver of a redeeming quality in him but....nope, rest assured...there are NONE!!!I really can't say much here except for the fact that this was one of those books where I was watching a movie in my head from start to finish. There is a lot of conflict and A TON of action! So much happens in the story line- you just have to read it for yourself. I laughed a few times, cried, it had some sweet moments, disturbing moments, and some sexy sexy, hot moments!This book is unique in the sense that it does not solely focus on characters A and B. Eve and Angel are certainly still at the forefront of the story but they share the spotlight. We get to know Ink MUCH better in Carnal Desire which I did not mind AT ALL. In fact, he might just get his shot at his own HEA after having his heart broken in Severed Angel...maybe? Possibly? Or is this playboy, man-whore capable of such a thing?So therefore, the book really focuses on Eve, Angel, Ink, Elle (new character), Satan of course, and then the rest of the Severed gang.The main theme of the book is really good vs. evil. It's the Severed crew vs. the now rogue biker that Satan has become. How far can his evil reach and can he infiltrate the Severed MC and bring them down once and for all? Who will be targeted? Who's the rat? Who is safe? And who will crack under pressure? And what happens when this man completely loses his marbles and decides that attempting to even the score with just Eve, is not nearly as much fun as torturing this entire group one at a time?I will say, Carnal Desire is NOT for the faint of heart!And that ending...Amazing, crazy suspense!!

Please read my full review on the Smoocher's Voice Blog.Josh Lanyon grabs the reader&#8217;s attention quickly and thoroughly with the novella Everything I Know. Inspired by Robert Fulhum&#8217;s book All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten, this story is charming and realistic. The list at the beginning of the book sets the tone for this tale. The intriguing, realistic characters draw the reader into the plot through the wonderful, and sometimes humorous, dialogue.Conner Myers loves teaching kindergarten. He loves the students; he is friends with his fellow teachers. He even likes some of the parents, especially the hot Wes Callahan, Lizzy&#8217;s father. But when Lizzy is injured on the playground, Conner&#8217;s world turns upside down. Without a clear school policy in place and with a very upset little girl on his hands, literally, Conner takes Lizzy to the emergency room at the nearest hospital.Wes Callahan, Lizzy&#8217;s over protective father, is not pleased when he finds out that not only has Lizzy been hurt at the school, but also one of her teachers has driven her to the hospital in his personal car &#8211; without permission. To say Callahan is completely freaked out would be an understatement.In this novella, Josh Lanyon has created a realistic and tension-filled tale. The turmoil in this story, unfortunately, is representative of the real world of education. The prejudices against male teachers, especially male elementary school teachers, are very real, and this story brings this issue front and center. The relationship that develops between Wes and Conner seems unlikely and yet it is sort of perfect.This is a great story, and Lanyon&#8217;s talents once again shine through character development and dialogue. Callahan&#8217;s simple admission that he is an ass adds a touch of humor that helps bring realism to romantic aspect of the story. In typical Josh Lanyon style, the characters and plot are presented in an engaging fashion and the reader is left wanting for more.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This is a great story", "unixReviewTime": 1402272000, "reviewTime": "06 9, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "AT2ZB20OCU7X2", "asin": "B00KMFZB8E", "reviewerName": "avid reader \"love 4 books\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "Just a fun read and enjoyable read.

Of course it not all sunshine and roses as the two navigate past hurts and current issues that keep both of them from fully delving into the romance and trusting the other to be what they need. This is an emotionally charged drama that really has an authentic story at heart, delving into the real drama of two people who need to move on from the past and step into the promising future ahead of them... one that could be a forever kind of love.The well-written novel deals with everything from the issues with navigating an interracial romance to healing from past relationships that have left both Keisha and Jake wary of falling in love again. Ms. Williams sucks the reader in with vivid imagery, strong dialogue, authentic characters and an engrossing plot that keeps you eagerly reading from start to finish.

Having lost the love of his life years prior he didn&#8217;t think to ever find another to take her place until the occupant of the delivery opened her door showing him all her glory in sheer lace!

Being older and not getting any younger she feels beat out by the much younger and prettier woman and having her ex-boyfriend leave her for a younger woman just poked at her self-esteem about her looks even more.

The Silence of the Stars is a 'spin-off' of The Stars That Tremble. I'm not sure of the differentiation between spin-off and sequel, but there you have it. We are introduced in more detail to Sandy Sullivan, Mike's childhood friend from the first book . Sandy works as a contractor for Mike's home remodeling business and is hired to remodel Everett Blake's horrible orange monstrosity of a kitchen.  Everett just came out of a long-term relationship. He is a professor at the school where Gio (now engaged to Mike) teaches. He is a classically trained violinist, and comes from a cultured, wealthy family where education is paramount. Everett is Upper East Side Manhattan, Sandy is Brooklyn blue-collar.The Silence of the Stars  works as a standalone, but having the background provided by the first book is helpful. Mike and Gio are secondary characters in this story, which mostly revolves around Sandy's PTSD and its effects on his life as a civilian and those around him. Sandy is an Iraq and Afghanistan veteran. He served fourteen years under DADT and was medically discharged after a car bomb killed his closest friend over there and left him with a crippling case of PTSD. His symptoms have lessened considerably in the six years he has been home, but he still suffers from vivid nightmares and periodic flashbacks.Sandy, while refusing to apply the label &#34;PTSD&#34; to himself, doubts anyone can deal with his messed-up head for long. He has kept most of his symptoms to himself, not sharing them with his family or even his best friend Mike, who is also a veteran. He doesn't even want to spend the night with Everett because he fears Everett's reaction if he sees him caught in the clutches of a nightmare. When he accidentally falls asleep and wakes up having thrown Ev to the floor, the truth about the depth of his struggles comes out.Everett is supportive and comforting, but  worries he's getting into a situation he doesn't know how to handle. He fears that Sandy might get violent and unpredictable, like a man his friend was involved with who had PTSD. Ms. McMurray dealt very well with PTSD and the struggle so many of our veterans live with when they return from war. There is still a huge stigma in admitting that you are damaged on the inside. Wounds on your flesh are easily explained, the physical limits they cause understood.  But acknowledging that your mind and your heart may not heal is something that remains difficult to this day. I felt that Ms. McMurray's research was very solid on this front.I found nothing really wrong with this book. The main characters were both nice, fairly ordinary guys who meet, go out, and actually talk about their relationship. They kiss and hold hands, not shy in the least about public displays of affection.  Their relationship progresses without angst, breakups or major misunderstandings. Things were far from perfect between them, but they wanted it to work, because loved each other and truly felt futures would be better together than apart. I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop; to introduce the angst and separation they need to come back together as a stronger unit. It never came.I found the book to be bland. The heat was missing from the sex, which was often alluded to but rarely seen on the page. There was very promising talk of kink, but we never got to see if it happened or not.  Much of Sandy and Everett's conversation felt awkward. There were too many internal monologues on the part of both MCs, many of them were repetitive and didn't synch with what was happening on page.Everett's parents were stereotypical. Their every word and move predictable. Even though they had readily accepted their son's homosexuality, they were unable to accept his choice in men because of Sandy's background, both economically and educationally. They were snobby and judgmental to the extent that they almost became caricatures. I loved New York City and the outer boroughs as a backdrop for the story. They are almost characters on their own. I got a good feel for the varied cultures and character of the city.I love Kate McMurray&#8217;s writing, it&#8217;s thoughtful and thought provoking. Her characters usually have so much depth. Her main characters are real flesh and blood, and they have a vulnerability that rings true. The blue collar guy with the classical musician, such an unlikely pairing, yet so right for each other. I feel like The Silence of the Stars was a missed opportunity.

I think it's because it's hard to capture the world and characters in such a short amount of time. I am one of those people who needs the extra pages to gain a fondness for the characters.

I think I read the first page 4 times. Finally, I decided to put my head down and JUST READ IT. I'm glad I did!The world building, obviously, isn't the greatest because it is a novella, but the characters were flushed out enough that the book grabbed me after the first dozen pages and I needed to finish it in one sitting.

While the writing of the ending (don't know why) I didn't particularly like, I liked the story as a whole. I didn't feel like I was \"missing\" anything profound to jump into the world of the Collectors. I also didn't feel like I was really missing anything with the characters' histories. I will say, you do know you're missing JUST enough that it keeps you wanting to read the others so you can delve further into the world, which is a good thing, but not enough to detract from the story.

This is something entirely new for me, a series of novellas written by different authors to be released one at a time! Normally I'd read an anthology where we have a theme of some sort, but these novellas will all take place in the same world! So it's definitely going to be an exciting series to read! And quick too!Nevada Hamilton is a dhampir and a Collector. From what I could gather, it basically sounds like a police force for supernaturals. I wasn't able to get a good grasp on the Collectors and their buildup, other than that they collect supernatural bad guys for The Boss, who remains a nameless figure, but this is the first in the collection, so I guess answers are meant to be given so soon!When her boss, not The Boss, tells her she has to Collect a certain vampire and that her partner will be the hellhound, Jake Troubadour, Neve is not a happy camper. She and Jake had a thing once three years ago and she's never looked back on it. Needless to say, it didn't end well. Having to work with the hellhound after so much time has passed by doesn't please her. She's been doing her best to push him out of her life.Jake on the other hand, isn't too thrilled with working with Neve either. He's a bit hurt from her actions three years ago. He hasn't been able to get her out of his mind either. And naturally this leads to a boatload of romantic tension between the two.I have to say that Amanda did one helluva job writing this novella! She packed sooo much into so few pages. There was history between Neve and Jake, and we got the details along the way and then there was even more buildup around the mysterious villain! And even a hint at what her next novella from this series would be come August! It was remarkable! I always find trying to write a novella is harder than the novel, because you basically have to combine all those novel writing elements into the novella, but give the story in under a hundred (or so) pages. That's freaking hard!! Which is probably why I didn't do so hot in my high school short story class...in college my first critique group loved my over the page limit story!Anyway, this novella was just awesome! I loved it! The action was well paced and the romance was to die for! I loved that there was even something &#34;chemical&#34; between Neve and Jake. Something threatens to keep them apart and it will take a lot of willpower from the two of them to work it out. And let's just say wow! I wasn't expecting my own kind of reaction from the two of them! I was totally thrown into their ordeal and dying to see what would happen between them! Novellas can sometimes have an odd effect on me! I might enjoy it, but never feel totally involved in the loving of it or whatever, so yeah, I was surprised by how much I sank into this one like I do with a regular novel!To make an insanely long review short, ha!, this was the first in a new novella series and I have to say that if you love Paranormal Romance and Urban Fantasy, then definitely check this series out! There's a great lineup of authors and if you see even one name you are at all familiar with, then I suggest you buy, buy, buy the entire lineup! The series is going to have different characters with each novella, but they are all in the same world, so we might yet again see Neve and Jake pop up in the next one!Authors to look for in this incredibly amazing series are: Amanda Carlson, Kristen Painter, Sara Humphreys, Angie Fox, and Shawntelle Madison!Overall Rating 4.5/5 stars--again, my only complaint was not fully understanding who the Collectors are as a group and who the mysterious Boss is.

They are not a normal coupling.  They don't know they are mates, and have no idea that they started the bonding process three years ago and have avoided each other ever since.  Forced to work together to collect a supernatural, neither one is happy.  Things get hot sexually, before it blows up again and Jake leaves.

Unfortunately for her, Ash has always been kind and friendly towards her&#8230; emphasis on friendly. He&#8217;s never looked at her as anything other than a friend. However, that&#8217;s about to change if Lexi has anything to do with it.I found this to be an incredibly sweet story and great if you are looking for a quick, non-complicated novella. My only issue of contention is Lexi&#8217;s behavior. She seems very manipulative. He won&#8217;t approach her at the bar, so she dances with his friend&#8230; he won&#8217;t go with her to a secluded beach alone with her, so she threatens to go hunting for bears by herself. Her behavior was more reminiscent of a 17 year old, not a 27 year old. That being said, their romance was actually tugs at the heartstrings.

Nico turns her life upside down and makes her fell alive again....Nico knew the moment he saw Sophie that she was the one. He got his BOOM.

He knows what he wants and goes after it. He's not putting up with any of Sophie's excuses. Even though Sophie and Nico were complete opposites, they were great together. I loved watching them fall in love.My only complaint that I have is that I felt that the end was a little rushed. I wanted there to be a little more drama/action. There was all this build up with someone wanting to hurt Sophie and I felt like it was resolved way too quickly.

Asher, Trevor, Cash, Nico?  You shouldn&#8217;t have to.  They are all Delicious and their own kind of Alpha.Sophie Grates is a 23yr old middle school librarian. Her mother died when in a car accident when she was 15 and lets say her father died along with her. He couldn&#8217;t face his own daughter and turned to alcohol to grief. Bad move on his part because its one of the reasons Sophie got emancipated at 16. His irresponsibilty of not watching his daughter lead to one night that turned Sophie into the lonely, panic young woman she grew up to be. Sophie only managed to make 2 friends while her time at the Job Corps. She is so terrified of people she would rather be a loner. I don&#8217;t blame her. It&#8217;s an ugly world out there. I don&#8217;t think her situation is giving up on life, its more being scared of what happens when you let poeple in. She has been on her own since 16.So what happens to this super shy young woman, who doesn&#8217;t like people touching her, and she&#8217;s faced with a Meyson brother. Not just any Meyson brother, we&#8217;re talking about Nico. Remember&#8230;ex-construction worker who sold his part of the family company to the brothers, who lets not also forget is a Bounty Hunter.If you&#8217;ve read the previous Until books, you know there is no giving up for these boys. The BOOM (The Meyson curse).&#8220;You, know the moment I saw you, I knew you were the one for me. You&#8217;re mine, Sophie. Every beautiful inch of you is mine.&#8221;In this case I think it hit Nico really, really hard and fast. Poor Sophie didn&#8217;t even stand a chance. It was either she got over her fear or Nico ws going to vanish it out of her, amongs other things he does to her. Oh and Sophie is a virgin which made it even more fun for the Beast that Nico is.&#8220;I hate that you were worried. I just didn&#8217;t know what to do. I feel like ever since I met you, I have wanted something I&#8217;ve never wanted before, and that scares me. I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m doing, and my head is all messed up. I just want to make sure I&#8217;m good enough for you.&#8221;I call him a Beast because from the first timehe meets her he&#8217;s already so demanding. I thought that Sophie was going to pee on herself. He&#8217;s so big, has a fauxhawk, gauges in his ears and has tattoos all over his body. Total opposites attract. Still that didn&#8217;t stop Nico. Of course not. Alpha on overdrive. What man thinks and wants for their first time with a girl to get her pregnant? Oh, this fudger does. Like seriously no condom, I want her knocked, married moved in with me in a matter of weeks. No make that days. He is straight up Cray-Cray. Crazy head over heels in love with Sophie. I loved how he sort of asked her if she wouldn&#8217;t mind, but at the same time knowing he was getting his way.Overall, a very fun read. Moved quite fast, but that was Nico&#8217;s caveman tendencies taking over. Needed to mark his territory all over the damn place. A bit emotional once you learn more about Sophie&#8217;s past. You will get some angst becuase you know Aurora has to give you something to spice up the story and she needed to put Nico&#8217;s bounty hunting skills to action. Nicely done. Author&#8217;s just a thought from my very opinionated brain&#8230;Please, Pretty Please, when a girl loses her V-card, can you make her cry, scream, possibly bleed?  I&#8217;ll leave you with Nico&#8217;s proposal to Sophie because well I felt I needed to share his Alpha side gone Mr. Softy. I also recommend you give the other books in the Until Series a chance and check out for yourself where the BOOM began. Happy Readings!!Nico&#8217;s proposal to Sophie:I knew from the moment I saw you I would do everything within my power to make myslef worthy of you. I was going through lofe one day at a time, nd then you came along and gave me a reason to plan for tomorrow. Every second, every minute, and every day, I will prove to be a better man, a man worthy of you, a man who will lve you the same way you love me for who I am, not what others see me as.

They combine Fibonacci Retracements with other technical indicators such as Moving Averages and Support and Resistance levels.  Fibonacci Retracements are psychological support/resistance levels within a certain range of price levels in an upward/downward trending movement.  Essentially this means that stocks will often retrace a % of their previous move before reversing.  Fibonacci Retracements often occur at 38.2%, 50% and 61.8%.

I have devoured another one of C.L's books within 3 hours.  She has succeeded in making each new book in this series better than the one before. This book has much more drama than you can ever imagine. To make this easier, I'm going to name off some characters and summarize their role in this book.Sang: Sang has been one of my favorite characters in the book. She is assertive, hard-working, and strong, mentally and physically. She deals with a lot of drama in this book. Between Rocky drama, Mr. Griffin, Jade, and much more, she has loads of problems to deal with.  It pains me to say that she deals with some hard situations and uncomfortable decisions, but she will get through them, not without scars and bruises though. As some might know, this is the book in which Sang gets her first kiss....Let's just say the kiss won't disappoint any readers. Just know everyone will get their kiss. Okay, moving on..Nathan: Nathan is the main character in the book and also my favorite for this book. When his dad comes back he has to learn to stand up for himself and fight back a little. Nathan struggles to convey his feelings to Sang in this book also. He doesn't want to hurt her but he finds out how she feels in one of the bad situations that happens to her. He will rise to the occasion as the main guy for this book.Kota: I'm sad to say that you don't see much of him in this book. Luckily, no drama happens involving him in this book. Although he is not in this book a lot, he does have a nickname for her.  ;)Victor: I seriously love Victor. (DON'T CONTINUE IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THE OTHER BOOKS) As you know since he admitted his love to Sang in the last book, he is more in sync with his feelings for her. He continues to spoil her and treat her like a \"princess\".North: North has good parts just this book. He finally gets to take her out on that date. (That's all I'm gonna say.............)Silas: Silas is pretty popular at their school. He is supposedly the one dating Sang and he tries to claim her as best as he could so she doesn't get any trouble with the guys. Silas will have some punches to throw around....Don't worry.....it will be epic. ;)Luke: Luke oh Luke! I am seriously in love with him. He is the best. He has some good roles in her but not the biggest......Gabriel: Gabriel doesn't have too much roles but he will get some fun time with Sang.....Mr. Blackbourne: I believe every book we read, every time we get a little more of him. He is like a onion. You keep peeling and peeling. One layer= one book. He opens up a little more.Sean aka Dr. Green: Sean gets a lot of roles in this book. He and Sang connects a lot more. Let me just tell you know.....He will do something unexpected but not what you think. or maybe it is. Teehee.Other characters:Rocky: Stirs up some trouble... So does..DanielleMarieJade (You'll find out something disturbing about her)Will: He gets literally one part in the book. Oh and it is good.Karen: She will help Sang out in some hard situationsJay: Not as bad as you thinkOverall, this book is very good. The books before have been almost a little more tender and fragile. It was as if they were glass. Something could go wrong and BOOM it shatters! This book feels more real and solid. I am finally getting a taste if the real life of the Acadamy. Oh and if you have read The Thief just know you'll see some of them on and off in the book. Once again I strongly recommend this book. It is worth the four dollars that you planned to use at McDonald's. So worth it!! This isn't a book in the series you can skip. Don't even try. I swear once you read it you will love it.Btw, if your not a fan of the reverse harem thing going on than don't read. (I honestly don't understand when people leave a bad review when they know it's going to be centered around that) Anyways, I hope you enjoy the much as I did.

Every woman wants to find her Prince, it is not always easy to but this book gives us the tools we need to make it possible.

I will definitely read more from Annalisa Nicole and I would recommend the books to others. If you have been following the series you have already met the family and are pretty well acquainted with the whole Wellington clan and their extended families as well. This book is about Adrian Wellington and his ex-wife Shay. I will admit I did not read books 1 & 2 but that did not hinder this book at all for me.Adrian is a HOT,single 35 year old. He runs a construction company and loves being with his family. For years he has been missing something or maybe just someone. You quickly learn that 17 years ago he was married to his high school sweetheart Shay. After a tragedy strikes them Shay takes off without a word leaving behind only divorce papers. Leaving Adrian to pick up the pieces of a life changing injury and some serious depression. Now on the brink of a great work project Adrian is face to face with the woman who ruined him. When Shay took off all those years ago she went to college and became a pretty successful architect. The memories of that tragic day have never been far from her mind. Because of her choices she lost the only man she has ever loved. Now forced to move back to her hometown to care for her sick mother Shay will be forced to face her past and finally tell the truth and find closure about her leaving. Reading about both their loses and suffering was heartbreaking. I could relate and understand their insecurities. I loved reading about their re-connection. It was a beautiful heartfelt story of love , healing and honesty. Of course the HOT SEX was a bonus !!!!!WHAT I LOVED-* Absolutely hands down loved the Wellington family ! I enjoyed what each and everyone of them brought to the story and what they will be bringing to future stories !!* Adrian is a phenomenal hardworking guy ! He is so full of love for his family and Shay.* I loved the twists and turns , the bits and pieces of real life drama that were easy to connect with.* Without spoiling I have to say that I LOVE what Shay and Adrian do. It was beautiful and heartwarming when they opened their hearts and home.WHAT I DISLIKED-* SHAY OMG she drove me crazy. This happens every now and then in books. I understood her reason for leaving 17 years ago. But her actions during certain parts of the re-connection were just immature and ridiculous. I wanted to strangle her. Adults are suppose to talk things out.*As much as I loved what they did to create their family I hated how they jumped so fast to do that without any real reasoning and then how it happened so fast for them it just seemed unrealistic.I am looking forward to going back and reading books 1&2 and Annalisa set up a great path for the next few stories as well !!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Love the Wellington Family", "unixReviewTime": 1402185600, "reviewTime": "06 8, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "ADRJ61RZVM18P", "asin": "B00KQ1WQUU", "reviewerName": "brandi hopkins", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "This book has a good story behind it and the artist tries his hardest to hide from cameras.

The heroine Mia is your average party girl who always having drinks and sex. Good times, good times. But with all the good times, she is lonely and needs more, than the good times.One evening while Mia is at the club she meets Grayson, who happens to be her kindred spirit.  When reading this book, you will find that these two souls are made for each other, similar to Plato&#8217;s&#8217; theory of the bellybutton. Well if you haven&#8217;t heard the story before, here it is (bet you did not think you would be getting a philosophers story while reading a review on this book). Once upon a time&#8230; LOL.Two people who were made for each other (physically, mentally, and spiritually were conjoined. Their love for one another was so great that they were separated per the gods request. (I know heartless bastards).  After they were separated, Apollo, sowed their bodies up, only to leave a bellybutton so they could once again find their soul mate. The humans lived in angst, searching to find their soul mate. Through misery, with hope to see their soul mate again.Grayson and Mia are my version of this concept. They were both two hurt, lost souls. When they meet they feel their powerful connection to one another. They feel something different, than the numbing of their life from meaningless sex. They have found one another. Two peas in a pod. Yet, Mia is resistant to this connection. She only wants sex from him. Per Mia, &#8220;Save a horse, ride a cowboy.&#8221; The question is will Mia let her past go and be with her soul mate.Grayson by far is so profoundly awesome. He has this realness about him. He is so vocal of what he wants and if this had some bondage in it, I might call him a Dom in the making. Though he acquiesces to Mia on many occasions and is patient with her fears, like her knows himself, he only did this to keep her near. His devotion for her was off the charts.The supporting characters did a wonderful job and their words were powerful and help to guide Mia and Grayson&#8217;s story along beautifully. All the characters were so real.Overall, I was pleased with this story and the graphics.P.S. I would love to get Steph&#8217;s story.

Robyn Peterman is my go-to author when I need a pee your pants funny read, and when I saw that she came out with Ready to Were in an anthology with two other authors, I knew I needed to read it. I poured myself a cup of coffee and cozied up with my Kindle. (Sidenote: I think I need to name my Kindle; since he and I spend an entirely large amount of time in bed together!)First up in this book was Kathleen Brooks and All Hung Up. You meet Taylor Jefferies, a Hollywood starlet and Trey Everett, small town football star turned pro. Both choose a quiet life in Hung Island, Georgia instead of the bright lights of the big city. This incredibly sweet story of the world's hardest proposal had me in a non-stop fit of giggles. The grand gestures in the romance genre will never grow old with me. And this story is no exception. &#34;You deserve so much more than a country boy like me, but I promise no one will love you as much as I do. I fell in love with you by the pond in Keeneston the night we first met, and I've spent these past years falling more and more in love with you. Not only do you make me a better man, we make each other stronger. We're a team, a family, and I would love nothing more than to be your husband.&#34; By the end of her contribution to this anthology, I added all her books to my TBR shelf on Goodreads and my Wish List on Amazon!Our second trip to Hung Island, Georgia is Divorced, Desperate and Dangerous by Christie Craig. Reese Morris walks into Casey's Honkytonk Diner to run away from her problems back home. A broken heart, a breech of trust, a witnessed murder leads her to pouring coffee and serving up the best damn breakfast on all of Hung Island - to the locals first, of course. Reese hopes this help keep Trey Freedman - or Turner Calder, as she learned was his real name - off her mind.In this diner, she finds her peace in a gun-toting lady by the name of Casey and a former FBI agent who she dropped eggs on and paid $20 to smile so she could get the job! In walks, Trey Turner and asks to be sat in her section. &#34;What the hell did he want with her? What part of, 'The tooth fairy ill be serving cherry Popsicles in hell before I give you the time of day again,' did he not understand? Had she not been clear?&#34; This story was full of suspense and I felt like I was turning the pages so quick to get the the HEA.Turner has an amazing group of friends, Cops and PI's who are all content on never getting close to a woman again. They are a group of divorced men who called themselves the No Ball and Chain Gang. They watched out for each other if any were in danger of getting to close to getting in too deep with a woman. Nobody held a chance in stopping Turner from making things right between him and Reese. And as much as Reese wasn't having his apologies, it was hard not to loose yourself in Turner - after all, &#34;Let me tell you, if he was gravy and I was a biscuit, I'd sop that plate clean.&#34; I cannot believe I have never read any books by Christie Craig - she is talented beyond belief. She also pens YA novels under the name C.C. Hunter! And my TBR lists grows...To wrap up our vacation on Hung Island, Robyn Peterman fills us in on the stories we heard briefly during the treasure hunting about the paranormal activities on Hung with her deliciously witty story, Ready to Were. Robyn tosses you knee deep into the Council, a paranormal government that ran all things supernatural. WTF (Werewolf Treaty Federation) is who Agent Essie McGee worked for. Essie ran from Hung Island when she caught the love of her life, Alpha of her pack and the sexiest Were around cheating on her. Chicago is where she finally stopped. Dwayne is her 300+ year old Vampyre best friend she only answered to her Granny, and the WTF! When Essie gets an assignment that sends her back to Hung - she is not pleased to be working with the local pack alpha and sheriff.&#34;Name's Hank Wilson. You know him?&#34;&#34;Yep.&#34; Biblically. I knew the son of a b***h biblically.With Dwayne tagging along, she heads to Hung Island to be the professional she has worked so hard to become. Essie knew she could work with Hank, get the job done and be back to Chicago before she knew it. Turns out Hank doesn't want to work with Essie either! He makes her prove herself with her impeccable gun skills and than hand-to-hand combat. &#34;Pinned underneath him on the floor, my inner wolf hooker was ecstatic.&#34; No time for nonsense, they had missing were's to find all while maintaining the cover that Essie was home to work out their &#34;issues.&#34; Ester and Henry were on the job! Dragons, Fairies and Vampyres beware. This duo is dangerous.Hank's older brother, Junior is who I am petitioning for to get their own story! (And Dwayne of course, but I am sure he needs no help getting Robyn's attention in his Prada wedges and Gaga drag!) Junior's secret is safe with him - but when he finally steps up and takes over the Pack, he is going to be a force of nature and the woman who finally tames him - I need to be her friend. That will be one fierce lady. The HEA was perfect in this one. Sand in inappropriate places, Grandma in a thong bikini and a gay Vampyre demanding to see the ring - what better way to end the fun and giggle filled vacation to Hung Island? &#34;Weird was my new normal - accept and continue.&#34;My favorite aspect of this anthology was that all the stories tied the location together. When I picked it up, I thought all would be beached themed stories, but to have them all with a central location made them all flow so well.

What wonderful, giddy, un-guilty pleasure and fun there is in compulsively page-turning your way through Christopher Nuttall's wonderful naval adventure novels.They are set in future space, of course, but they are squarely in the tradition of C.S. Forester's Horatio Hornblower novels and --so far as spirit is concerned-- Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey and Maturin tales. Nuttall tells a great story skillfully building characters we learn to care about and identify with.Action, action and more action propel these stories along almost as quickly as the good ship Ark Royal folds space to cross near-Sol space. Nuttall captures for us the feel and sense of his imaginary world without bogging us down in unnecessary technical malarkey --often a pitfall of aspiring science fiction novelists-- but instead sketches out for us a set of rules in which the action takes place most comfortably and which is never undercut by a deus-ex-machina &#34;What if we use the Framulous Hypergel Guns from the original armament?&#34;Another major departure is Nuttall's refusal to hang his stories on the shoulders of just one character. Admiral Sir Theodore Smith, V.C., DSO, etc.;and his internal struggles are central to the tale, as is his predilection to dive into the bottle from time to time. But his XO, James Fitzwilliam; Major Parnell of the Royal Marines; Kurt Schneider, the commander of the carrier's fighter group; and many more well-drawn characters add richness to the literary feast Nuttall provides.If Nuttall had penned ten more novels, I would be working my way through them right now, the way I worked through all the Forester and O'Brian novels &#34;back in the day.&#34; Nuttall has not yet risen to the mastery of atmosphere created by Forester, but he gets inside the heads of his characters nearly as well. Nor is Nuttall the elegant literary stylist that O'Brien was, but his prose is snappy and full of energy. These three novels, Ark Royal, The Nelson Touch and The Trafalgar Gambit are wonderfully entertaining and edge-of-your-seat exciting.

The race of aliens that the author created as the protagonists in the story are so improbable that they are minutely close to impossible. Why?  Basically the species violate all kinds of attributes that would evolve into a highly technological civilization.Start with the basic driver that causes a species to change and acquire new attributes. It's need. The need to survive in a hostile world or to take advantage of that world's conditions. The environment may be changing, or they may be threatened by other, more powerful species. Or they may take advantage of such favorable conditions that they grow ever bigger, but there is no driver that would cause this group to change basic characteristics. Nature is a selective breeder, with each species having to, by necessity, adapt characteristics that allows them to survive whatever environmental conditions that they live in.  This could be by becoming bigger/stronger/faster, producing many offspring so that some will survive, or in humans case, becoming smarter because we are none of those things. From the authors description none of the conditions seemed to exist that would drive the aliens out of the water onto the land and result in their ability to breath air.  They seem to be the top of food chain and have no reason to adopt new characteristics.But, the the main problem with this species is problems they seem to have being out of the water for any period of time, or at least in a hot very damp environment.The most fundamental ability that a species must have to develop into a technologically advanced civilization is the ability to control and usefire. And, to do so for long periods of time. Without that ability, metals could never be smelted, alloyed and formed into useful tools or weapons. The authors species could never man the great furnaces and mills that would be required to support the building of the space ships, guns, missiles, etc. needed for warfare. Abilities that would be needed even in the beginning of their equivalent bronze age on earth. How would the aliens of the book ever be able to mine for  the ores, and the fossil fuels necessary for this to happen. How could they build the machines that would necessary to do so without that ability.  They would have to have crawled out of the water millions of years ago and adapted the land, or they are going to remain what their environment made them, perhaps smart dolphins. Or smart fish, as they seem to have gills.There seems to be no driver that would cause them to move onto dry land in the first place, and they have not adapted well enough to dry land conditions. to be able to produce a technologically advanced civilization.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A Good Read, But...", "unixReviewTime": 1405468800, "reviewTime": "07 16, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "AJKCI255VJQK4", "asin": "B00KSFTUAI", "reviewerName": "beach.blanket.bingo.babe", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "I'm so glad to read more of this hot couple!

Where you are all JUST STOP IT!! But once her guard is down you find that you have fallen for her, completely. I think that shows volumes of RD&#8217;s writing style she is able to take someone you are not crazy about and just make you stop and say OMG I completely understand her. I just wanted someone to show her love, someone to hold her, someone to show her how special she was. I wanted her to be who she was meant to be.&#8220;All girls dream at one point in their life, And we all hurt when they&#8217;re crushed.&#8221;I was introduced to Lyric at the end of Learning To Heal, and was more than intrigued with wanting to know a little (a lot) more about him. Now what can I say about Lyric, one word, WOW. I was instantly in love with this guy the moment I met him. And with this book the more I got to know him and was in his head the more I adored him. He is beyond driven, so compassionate and if I was to create a man for Blaire he would be it. Lyric has his own demons and his own problems but that is what makes this relationship so powerful and maybe one of the best rides.&#8220;Every crack, every smear, and every mistake isn&#8217;t a mistake at all. It&#8217;s something that&#8217;s just simply meant to be and made me who I am.&#8221;R.D. Cole completely stole my heart again and had my emotions bouncing all over the place.

This is the second in a series about a paranormal prison called Purgatory off the coast of Washington state.

It wasn't really necessary since this can be read as a standalone, but it was more enjoyable with the background of knowing the characters. Shane's introduced as just a regular agent in a secret organization based in Seattle called Para Unit. They're a secret branch of the FBI. But that's not all he is. He's also a very old vampire. The only thing is, in the first book, The Wolf Within, he's said to been born/made in the 1300's and in this book he's 2000 years old. So, not sure there...This book starts off when Shane meets Dr. Olivia Maddox on the ferry ride to the island prison and sparks fly from there. Olivia is there to interview the prisoners to figure out why they kill. Shane is there to figure out who's trying to make the prisoners try for escape. Of course nothing goes right for either of them and they start off on a run for their lives.I loved Shane's character from the start. What's not to like about an alpha badass vampire? Uh, nothing. Olivia was the right parts vulnerable and tough. More beta then alpha, but kick-ass just the same. She ends up on a journey where she not only finds love, but herself as well.

All story, no waffling! This one is paranormal ( its that vampire bit in the title that gives it away &#8211; yes?) and was a fun read.To begin with we're given a clue that some people aren't exactly what they seem, and that there is clearly some uncover/underhanded work going on. That fits in with much of Cynthia's novels that I've enjoyed, they have that suspense element and she does that really well, keeping me guessing exactly whats happeneing. So it was with this one, til it got to the point where I was wondering just what and who was going to be revealed next...dealing and double dealing, people who were working for others and not the side I expected, all wrapped up with some danger, violence, and sexy, sensual sex....A great mix.I liked Shane right from the start, and it was clear that he was in Purgatory for reasons other than what were given, but I didn't know who else was in on that, and what he was actually there for. Olivia seemed a troubled person, seeking to find out what made killers act as they did, but she didn't fit the usual &#8220;do-gooders&#8221; mould, and wasn't afraid of danger &#8211; til she reached Purgatory where the danger wasn't just the usual from interviewing dangerous prisoners, but had the added addition of someone &#8211; or maybe several someones &#8211; flipping and messing with the safety measures. Why, who, when and where was the next danger coming from. It's a novel full of suspense and danger and some vivid surprises, but with a perfect ending. Its the second in a series, I've not read the first but that was fine, as it seems each is a standalone, but with connected characters so it's the sort I like, where novels are complete but integrated with each other and carrying an overall story arc.

I had so many problems with each one, I kept wondering why i'm reading this if there wasn't a single character that I cared for. The premise was good, and it started out good. A prison for supernaturals, a doctor doing research, an unlikely hero and potential sizzling romance, what's not to love? right? wrong!The heroine: She was weak, and it was by the authors design. She was weak in the sense that opportunities for her to show strength and character was just glossed over, and often times forgotten, or not addressed. I also dislike self denial immensely. It's impractical and is a waste of time. So naturally I don't like that trait in any character. And Olivia was in denial about what she was constantly.The hero: A*****. I had no love for him. One minute he's spouting sonnets of how he would never hurt Olivia, blah blah blah, and the next he betrays her, and uses her, and/or allows others to use her. Really? This is his version of love?The dynamic between hero and heroine: This is where the heroine's opportunities to grow never happen. Her &#34;mate&#34; betrays her continuously in the books, fine. If it's a part of the plot sure, it's not so bad. What bothered me was the fact that the author failed to address this stuff between the two. It's like when they have a conversation, she doesn't even bring up that he betrayed/used her. It's as if it never happened. What was there for her to love about this guy? She couldn't trust him (and believe me that was clear), and he puts others before her all the time. I just didn't get it.Pate: A****. Yep to me, he may as well have been the villain. He claim Ethan's his friend yet he continuously put him in situations to have him betray his mate. I get that he runs a unit, and needs to think of the innocent, and play hardball. But seriously, It never occurred to him to &#34;ask&#34; anyone to participate in his plans? He just thought it was ok to bully them into it? Betrayal and lies left and right. And this is the guy Ethan trusts? Oh and you  know what else bugged me? Ethan is supposed to be all powerful, and yet, he kept doing whatever Pate asked of him. He kept saying &#34;my debt is paid&#34;, and the next scene is him still doing something pate asked him to do.

Along with her hallmark sizzle, Ms. Roberts showcases her ability to present a strong character. The strength of any worthy story is built around the characters, their thoughts, their decisions, their motivations. Ms. Roberts is the master of crafting the perfectly flawed character; they clutch onto their reality, own their decisions, and most of all shine with all of the nuances of  their individual humanity. It&#8217;s the characters that compel the reader to risk the journey. It&#8217;s the characters that compel the reader to invest in each step, that induces a curiosity that can only be satiated by finding a resolution. With each word, Ms. Roberts cultivates that curiosity and does a fine job entertaining the reader in the process. Even if that story is about a prostitute, a pimp, and an talent agent.What a potent trifecta, right?I have to admit, however, that I approach any story with such a lurid premise with a bit of trepidation. Stories with this subject matter usually delve into predictability rather quickly; desperate girl meets driven and determined bad boy while hero swoops in to save the day. Rather run of the mill and highly frustrating.Thankfully, Ms. Roberts doesn&#8217;t prescribe to the predictable tale.Yes, Angela is constructed as the desperate girl and yes, Jackson is the driven and determined bad boy but these characterizations are spun on their axis. Angela, though desperate, has not succumbed wholly to the lifestyle; instead she&#8217;s become an outsider in both her interactions with the others that reside in the house and within herself. I got the feeling that when she was with a john, she subconsciously left the building and returned when the deed was done, collected the money and went home.  End of story. There was no reveling in what Jackson, her pimp, provided. She merely took just enough to sustain herself. I felt divided by Angela, by her reasoning to stay rather than leave, to continue to subject herself to so much loneliness all for the sake of surviving. Not living, just surviving. But, that is what makes Angela so human in her decisions and why I can&#8217;t fault her motivations.Conversely, Jackson and Enzo turn out to be mirror images of each other. Both are powerful in their own right, both have a visceral command over the people in their lives and both have similar intents on possessing Angela. The difference, however, is the approach. Jackson maintains a sense of entitlement, of possession over Angela. In his warped sense of what love is, he gives just a little and then  expects a lot in return and although he believes he loves Angela, its nothing more than a play into his ego as are all the girls in his stable. Jackson had all the markings of the tragic hero (my favorite type of hero) but for me, he missed the target completely. There was no sense of redemption for him and oddly it works. He remains, however, nothing more than the tainted bad boy who has yet to meet his match.On the other end of that spectrum is Enzo. He is the savior, the white knight in shining armor, almost too good to be true.  He wanted to lift Angela out of the dregs of darkness into the light and did everything he could to make it happen. Yes, his was a intent of possessiveness too&#8230;but what mattered was that Angela was buying what he was selling and she was able to turn the tables simply because Enzo believed in her past what she could physically give him. I will admit, I was dubious of Enzo and his motivations but was won over by his sincerity. It became less about his needs and more about Angela&#8217;s gains. She had become more than something to be  simply possessed but revered.All the makings of a delicious love story.At the surface, Daddy&#8217;s Angel could&#8217;ve been a garish tale but instead became something much more brilliant, more substantial. It&#8217;s what I love about Ms. Roberts and her talent to infuse her words with spirit and conviction. She&#8217;s a bold storyteller, one that is determined to say what she has to say, regardless of the naysayers and cynics and continues to grow as an author. It is why I will continue to read and laud her  seemingly effortless attempts to enlighten and entertain.Excellent work, Ms. Roberts!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Surprisingly insightful", "unixReviewTime": 1402185600, "reviewTime": "06 8, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A28E0A80WYVZFO", "asin": "B00KUBC660", "reviewerName": "Kristen Stieffel", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "Scavenger is a fabulous story with breathtaking action and a relentless plot.

This is the story of a girl that climbs out of the pit of despair and learns how to trust and love again.  It takes two things for this to happen, first a VERY SPECIAL friend and a VERY SPECIAL man that will put the effort into a love of a lifetime.  In this story we find Keira with her cousin Scotty trying to deal with both Keira' s problems but also Scotty has lost his parents to.  Keira is not only is broken, she is alive but her parents died trying to protect her.  She's dealing with her guilt and trying to recover not only from her physical injuries but her emotional ones too.Our author takes a very delicate and very hidden problem and puts it out there in such a way that it is not a unaproachable subject.  With her very special writing skills of taking the reader into the story with her vivid descriptions the readers can feel the pain of the broken and despaired girl.  Feel the heartache she is going through and watch the emotional pain she goes through in trying to reach out.  Scotty and Liam have their own pains and emotional scars that Abby uses effectively in helping Keira to that place where she can reach her goal.  I see Scotty as the real hero in this story.  Not many would devote himself to another to this degree and yet not see it that way. Liam was special too but in a different way, he took that extra step and was patient in letting Keira find her own way.  Without giving away the story, you will find that Keira is also a very special person in what she does for both Scotty and Liam.This was an emotional read for me because if not for a VERY SPECIAL friend in my life it could have happen to me  but I was able to get out before it came to this.  I am gratified to see this in print in such a way that others are able to feel the pain of the person but not be involved themselves.  I can also see it as a leaning tool for those of us that could someday meet someone that this has happen to.  This, of course is a fictional story but it's one that happens more than anyone of us wants to admit.  I definitely rate this with a full 5 stars and highly recommend this to all.

I was captivated by Keira and mesmerized by Liam.  They are perfect compliments of each other.  Where one is broken, the other is the balm that heals.  My emotions were everywhere; there is not one part of my heart Abby Reynolds didn&#8217;t touch with this book-- sexy, soaring high and in the blink of an eye, chill inducing, numbing lows.

I wondered if I would be able to move on from the terrors she endured, or if I, too would shut myself off from the world.  Liam stole my heart with the care and compassion he showed Keira.This is a stand alone novel, without a cliffhanger.  Keira and Liam will continue their story in the second book.

I'll be very curious to see where his character ends up.With Ryn, well I just love love loved him.

'Soren: The Angel & The Prize Fighter' is the first novel in a new young adult paranormal series following teenage main character Beau as she discovers she is going to become an Angel.The story is well told and merges a darkly toned reality with the concept of angels existing amongst humans. Beau's life is difficult and she is forced to make some hard choices to help her sick mother. These choices put her in danger and made her almost instantly likeable. I liked the other characters also and look forward to learning more about them as this series continues.I will admit it took me a little while to get into the story simply because there were quite a lot of different characters and it was fairly fast paced so it just took some time to absorb everything. However as soon as I got into it I was captivated and very much enjoyed the interactions between the characters and the slow unveiling of various elements of the tale. The ending was just brilliant!

They are engaged to be married and things are starting to look up, unfortunately there is one black cloud still hanging over their relationship and it's about to pour. Now they are fighting for more than just their relationship, they are fighting to survive.Reciprocity was an amazing conclusion to a wonderful and addictive series, K.I. Lynn is a talented author who knows how to keep readers hooked on her stories! I've read many series where the final book left me a little disappointed and that is definitely not the case here, Reciprocity was the perfect way to end this series, it wrapped things up completely and no questions were left unanswered. Nathan and Lila are both incredibly well developed characters, the reader gets to know them very well throughout the entire series and we learn all about their tragic pasts.I was thrilled to see them so happy and so deeply in love in Reciprocity after everything that has happened. They are both very intense and deep characters and the emotional aspect of their relationship is fierce, their bond is unbreakable. Their relationship is so intense and passionate, the author writes some seriously hot sex scenes that will leave the reader begging for more. Nathan is a dirty talker and I loved every second of it!Of course It wouldn't be a very good book if there wasn't some drama and suspense and the author delivers it perfectly. Once the action picked up I was on the edge of my seat and holding my breath, the reader knows something is going to happen but the suspense is a killer. I felt that the author did an amazing job of describing the emotions of the characters and the anxiety they were feeling and how it affected their relationship. It made me feel like I was right there with them just waiting for everything to fall apart around them.Reciprocity has both Lila and Nathan's points of view which I loved, I was so attached to both of these characters after reading the series it was vital to me that I knew what both of them were thinking, feeling and doing! This story is very emotional, both of these characters have heavy emotional baggage and depend on each other for their mental well being and the pain and fear they go through is heartbreaking.I couldn't put this book down until I was finished and I loved the ending.

As is so often the case with m&eacute;nage stories, plot can take a rear seat to the sex.  While there was a lot of it in the book, Caitlyn O'Leary clearly wanted to tell a story in between the passion play that occurred between Olivia, Joshua, and Ian.  Unfortunately, I felt that the plot fell short.  It seemed to advance too slowly, and offered a less than stellar impact on the conclusion.  Even having the story drag as much as it did, the ending just seemed to be rushed.  There was no delightful &#34;ah-ha&#34; moment for me - it all stemmed anticlimactic.The heroine, Olivia, was a woman who overcame much from her childhood, earning her MBA and heading up a successful charity.  However, no matter how hard I tried to, I just couldn't like her.  She flip flopped so often emotionally between the, &#34;woe is me&#34; and the ball buster personna, that it gave me a serious case of whiplash.  The heroes, Joshua and Ian, should have easily rung my alpha male bell, but instead felt flat and one dimensional to me.  Seriously, living in Fate Harbor, where they were both acutely aware of several polyamorous households, it never occurred to them that they could have a multi partner relationship with Olivia?  I found the most interesting characters were Leif and Caleb, and even then the multiple references to the attention they were paying Isabella got old, fast.  I'm hoping that when Leif and Caleb's story is written, the plot will flow more smoothly and have more sexual tension.As much as I wanted to love this story, I simply did not feel engaged for the most part, and that left me disappointed.  Caitlyn O'Leary does get credit for making Protecting Olivia a story that's more than a poor excuse for a plot insinuated in between sex scenes, which is a common pitfall in this genre, but it wasn't enough to make me wild about the book.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "reviewed by Redz World Reviews", "unixReviewTime": 1402963200, "reviewTime": "06 17, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "AYRXW50YBYYJA", "asin": "B00KVI1RZS", "reviewerName": "L.

It's more than that really; this book is the end of an era, the final tale in an epic saga, a love story that spans 60 years, and the series that made you into the writer you are today.  I say that with love because as I re-read the Rough Riders series in preparation for CTMA, I noticed how much you've grown as a writer and even in the early stages of this series your stories were heads and shoulders above so many out there, but as time went on they became even better; deeper, more emotional, and truly special.  I also took note of every little hint regarding Carson and Carolyn's relationship and there were many but they were only the tip of the iceberg.There were some pretty big revelations in CTMA; we saw many facets of Carson and Carolyn and while some were surprising, some we'd seen all along if we paid attention.  We gained even more understanding of Carson, Calvin, and Charlie's responsibility of being stewards of the land something they passed down to their children as well as Casper's children.  We saw the burden of secrets that Kimmie and Carolyn knew but couldn't share with anyone else. We saw that sometimes history does repeat itself even when we swear it won't.  We saw the full story of many partial stories we'd seen throughout fifteen books and we saw it from the eyes of those who lived it.  We were treated to glimpses of the events that shaped many lives but most of all we learned that without Carolyn, Carson would have been a shell of a man.  That's not to say he wasn't exactly what she needed, but I think even Carson would agree that Carolyn was the backbone, the pillar of strength, and the fierce guardian of the McKay empire.  We saw a man realize that his life despite all the hardship, the tears, the joy, and the changes was completely wonderful because of the woman he knew he loved from the first moment he saw her and we saw a woman fight to make sure that their life together would continue on for years to come.I can't even begin to express the myriad of emotions I went through as I read this book.  I knew it would be an emotional journey but I had no idea how cathartic it would be.  I'd been preparing myself for this book for the last two years and honestly, I was okay with this series ending because I knew that at any time I could go back and revisit it and relive their journey.  I really loved the way you entwined so many of the past books into this one and how they each jarred a memory to be shared.  How you showed that no marriage is perfect; that even those couples who appear the most solid have had experiences that have shaped them and brought them to where they are today.  How a couple can have their ups and downs yet still maintain the love and lust they once had for one another even have 50 years together. I love that Carson shared with his nephews, niece, grandson, daughters in law and son in law that while his life with Carolyn wasn't perfect, it was theirs and theirs alone and he will always be the one to make sure she is taken care of and safe even if it means pissing off the people he loves most in the world next to his wife.From Long, Hard Ride through Cowboy Take Me Away you have given so much of yourself and you have given your readers and fans a ride they will never forget.  You have taught us that people change, relationships of all kinds take work, people come and go, and most of all that no matter what family comes first.  It isn't always pretty, but you don't come into this world alone and if you are lucky you don't leave it alone either--especially when you find that one person to be by your side forever.Thank you for sharing your talent with the world, for giving us this family to love, and for reminding us of all of life's lessons along the way.  I am thankful for you and your friendship; it means more to me than you'll ever know.PS---As emotional as this story was, thank you for the moments of laughter in it as well and for clearing up some questions I've had along the way.

Latu is a standalone contemporary romance (new adult) novel about Ruby and Noah, best friends since childhood, who have to deal with issues of confusion, misunderstanding and fear of loss when lust and physical attraction start to weave their way into their friendship. Psychological and emotional issues take their toll as we witness the characters evolve through their young adult lives. You can't help but root for them throughout the story. It's one of those deep seated friendships that you don't want to see end.I stayed up way too late one night while reading Scared To Death because I just HAD to know what was going to happen next. That feeling of not wanting to put the book down hadn't happened to me in a while. I loved the friendship between the 2 main characters. The secondary characters are loveable and the last chapter gives off the impression that one of them might end up with his own novel.The eccentric backdrop to this story is unusual and refreshing. Noah is into the art of the macabre, with a passion for making frightful masks and costumes and a good part of the story unfolds in an old house that is home to a wax museum.Ruby is a very smart young woman and Noah is extremely sexy and sweet. This being said, you do, at one time or another want to slap both of them in the back of the head (but I love them nonetheless!).A really smart, emotional, quirky, sexy, sad-but-happy book with a good balance of lightheartedness and drama, with unconventional characters that stand out from your traditional romance novel. I love the way C.S. Latu brings her story to life. Superbly written. This is her debut novel.Technical info: New Adult, Contemporary, Romance.

The overall work is well-integrated and polished.  The story flows easily and each leading character's POV change works well.  Best of all it's a high-paced story that grabbed me and kept me hooked from first to last.  Somehow all (or most) of the sprue and jagged bits that were present in Books 1 and 2 were cut off and polished out in Book 3: there was a more caring focus to it which perhaps hints that the author took a bit more time over its crafting.2. For the most part the story arc is credible, or if not absolutely grounded, at least it runs as a genuinely diverting entertainment.3. Although levels of creativity are at par with Books 1 and 2 (average) and there're no real surprises or twists in this linear story, technical details in most respects are excellent and environmental scene descriptions (a quality I look for in a zompoc novel) are right on the mark.4. Jillybean gets top billing in Book 3 with top marks earned for dissecting her psychology.  The ensemble cast sparkle at times with Sadie emerging as the action co-star but without much by way of three-dimensional development.  For example, the rationale behind her shifting relationship towards JillyB is told rather than explored and shown.  Suffice to say that Jillybean fans will not be disappointed. :pShortcomings:  (Remember 5 stars = The Exemplary Book)1. The Bounty Hunter begins with a zinging bang, then fades out into an ethereal boogyman.  Man, I was hanging out for a twist like TBH was in fact (e.g) Sadie's brother or one of Sarah's past bed-mates.  But no.  Big missed opportunity there in my opinion.2. Deus ex machinas are used to bridge plot holes and get the characters out of the doo-doo.  The miraculous arrival of XXXXX is a classic that had me shaking my head in disbelief. Also, more than one avoidable McGuffin also weaves its way into the yarn and is evidently used to pad out the narrative.  For example, Nico's wound requiring \"action\" and Sadie's illness providing \"distraction\".3. Abraham's cult was well handled but, as per Book 2, needed way more creative seasoning and depth.  Sorry, but in my opinion this class of Doctor No villain has been done to death by 50 years of Bond movies.  Like what the hell does Abe want with Baby Eve?  It's not explained...and his Wicker Man transposition was somewhat derivative.  Thomas Tryon's classic Harvest Home could have pointed the way: (e.g.) making a human sacrifice to \"appease\" the zombies instead of the present self-referencing artifice.4. No way would Sarah be able to do what she did at the end...no matter what her willpower.Overall Book 3 is easily the pick of the bunch and a highly enjoyable reading experience that kept me fully engaged from the first page to the last.  Okay, it has a few soft spots but none of them are of a serious nature.Go for it, you'll have no regrets...except to wish there was a Book 4 that meets or beats it on a quality entertainment experience.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "TAO Ends on a High Note", "unixReviewTime": 1405641600, "reviewTime": "07 18, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A2AHKN9W2U7IIM", "asin": "B00KX894J2", "reviewerName": "Jenni Shamburger", "helpful": [0, 1], "reviewText": "I truly enjoyed the first two books and eagerly awaited this one.

Or just let those dogs that are sleeping in the corner, just lie. Sometimes mystery and wanting to know the truth trumpets all that knows best.&#34;Collision&#34; by Kate L. Mary starts off with a punch. Our female lead is in a pretty nasty car accident. On her way home from school her Christmas break, her car skids and collides head on into a tree. She is banged up, but okay. During the time in the emergency room secrets are brought to life. Nothing she would have expected in her wildest dream. Kara's dad that she known her whole life is not her dad. Bad Part? You think there isn't something worse than this?? Well there is! Kara's mom has known this little fact for her whole life and chose not to let either him or her into this little secret. Kara's mom, Charlotte has her reasons. Some truths should never be told. Well little Miss Kara refuses to think so and goes on a journey of some unfortunate discovery. Which has her wishing she never made this faithful journey in the first place.I gotta say, when I read the synopsis it intrigued me and what made me want to sign up for the blog tour. I have always been a mystery girl. It was my first love before the &#34;Fifty Shades of Greys&#34; of the book world. When that came out and others like it, my love of mystery faded like fashion statements. But when I realized that I got two of the same type of genres that I loved, I dived right in. I wasn't disappointment with this book entirely, but I was disappointed with how the female character was portrayed in the book. I completely understand she found a devastating secret about her family and I would be hurt to if that was me. But my God. She put a whole new meaning into the word, &#34;Brat&#34;. Drammmmmmma was Kara's middle name and that annoyed me. She kept playing the &#34;woe is me&#34; card just a tad bit too much. If your mother tells you there is a reason for her not sharing who your dad really is then believe her!! Don't make her out to be Satan or the plague. She's your mom, moms have their reason that just the nature of the beast. Now on the other side of the token I would want to know who my father was too, but I would of been upfront with her and told her this was just something I needed and wanted to do. *sigh* Kara was infuriating and almost the reason I couldn't finish this novel, but lets enter the knight in shining armor shall we. Derek was the savior of this story for me! He was funny, smart, geeky and downright sexy. Aww loved him. Derek was admiring Kara since High School. So for their paths to run again after this development was good for Kara. Since she didn't want her mom around and her dad that she thought all along was her dad, abandons her, Derek was a good addition in her life to keep her in check. I liked him alot! I truly think he was the best part of this book.Once the secret is found out, who her dad really is you are basically telling yourself, &#34;Holy Shit..this can't end well&#34;. In some ways it really doesn't. The way the ending is setup it sounds like there could be a part 2, but looking at the author's Goodreads page it doesn't mention it. Time can only tell. This was a good story with a good pace. I just couldn't wrap my head around Kara. And sometimes you just can't with some characters. Don't pass this book up though because it is still good and entertaining read.Out of a 5. I'm giving this a 3.5.

I'm itching to be able to carry on reading the remaining books, but life had just been too busy.  Here's my full review of Dissension and my full review of the others will be posted as soon aa I'm done reading them.Katie Salidas has succeeded in writing something different from her other books, this is a dark, gritty page turner; where the tables have turned and the hunter is know the prey and the humans are more bloodthirsty than the vampires.The world that Katie Salidas has created for me was totally believable. I could see everything clearly in my own mind and I was soon completely immersed with Mira, Olivia and Lucian to name just a few. The characters are fantastic.At the front of the story we meet Mira. Mira is an amazing vampire. She's not afraid to stand her ground knowing full well that every time she does, she will be punished; horribly! But still she stands her ground and faces her punishment head on! I suspect that Mira's desire for freedom; both for herself and her fellow vampires; is what drives her on; and gives her the strength to continually fight against the rules and her punishments.There seems to be a human owner for the vampires, Mira is no exception. Mira's owner is Olivia. I can only think of one way to describe Olivia; she is a complete and utter bitch! I don't like her one bit, she's evil! Olivia is only out for monetary gain and really doesn't care about Mira, she will readily dish out punishments for the tiniest of things. The only time Olivia is happy is when when she gains from Mira's behaviour, so when Mira wins a fight in the arena or when Mira manages to secure herself a Patron!In this new world there is a human governor; of sorts; called the Regent. The Regent; Lucian; watches the battles in the arena and decides whether the final fatal blow is to be delivered. Lucian has seen Mira fight in the arena, but he meets her properly on her latest escape attempt. He claims to be intrigued by Mira and wants to get to know her. Lucian convinces Mira to allow him to escort her back to her cell so that her punishment will be less severe. Lucian also decides to be Mira's patron much to both Mira and Olivia's surprise; not the Olivia will be complaining as this will give her more money! Mira doesn't trust Lucian. Lucian is is wondering if what he learnt growing up about vampires is actually true.I was hooked on this book from the beginning. I love everything about the book; the characters, the plot and the setting. I especially love how Katie Salidas has turned the tables on the vampires; so that they are no longer the predators, they are now the prey.There is action and humour throughout, its dark and gritty, completely different to Katie Salidas' other books, and I have loved every last page.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excited about the remaining books!", "unixReviewTime": 1404691200, "reviewTime": "07 7, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "AV0DTTLGNW7C1", "asin": "B00KXIIZKG", "reviewerName": "Carly Rose (RuralMom)", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "Newly mated, Cage and Bindi are faced with the daunting task of breaking into the heart of the military's base in order to rescue the children.

In this installment we meet Erin and Zach who, along with their two daughters, have moved to Corbin's Bend in an effort to get their family back on track with a better implemented DD marriage. While Zach and the girls have adjusted well to the move, the same cannot be said for Erin. She's having a difficult time making friends and, understandably, feels shunned and lonely. Add would be expected, her feelings of isolation are worsened as she watches her husband and children flourishing.Although DD is not my preferred subgenre, I found Leading the Way to be a hoot and a half. Because a large part of the storyline focuses on Erin making friends, the reader gets dragged along for the ride as Erin and her new friends get up to no good on their bowling day. These ladies are a mischievous bunch that kept me chucking at their antics. The sex scenes were steamy, but I would have preferred more of them. That said, the focus of Leading the Way is the relationship between Zach and Erin and how it is enriched by living in Corbin's Bend.Ms. Masters has given readers a well written and entertaining novella that will enable you to return to Corbin's Bend and catch up on some former characters while meeting new ones.

I am not going to summarize the book because you can find the summary above and in other reviews.One thing I am not generous with is Five-Star Ratings but Lucian Bane earned every single one of them. Truthfully speaking, if there were 100 stars that could be given, I'd ask for 101. Lucian is a literary Genius and he certainly proves that in his writing. I read Dom Wars 5 in one sitting. I couldn't put it down! It's not that I didn't try, it was an impossibility. The first sentences grabbed me by my collar, dragged me into the center of the book, exposing my emotions, exploiting my senses, stealing any words I might have said. I laughed until I cried, my body shook with anger, my heart pounded with fear, my pulse raced with sizzling, erotic tension and my breath hitched as I struggled not to cry from heartbreak.Yes, it's like that! Every character that Lucian writes is so complex, have so many layers. They have their own personalities which explode off the page so brilliantly, you wonder if these are real people giving a first-hand account of the things they've experienced. He writes in such a way that is satisfying yet keeps you yearning, begging, needing more! More Lucian, more Tara, more challenges to dominate during the game. By the time you turn the last page you are speechless, spent, yet excited to see what comes next.Dom Wars 5 honestly left me in awe. It left me speechless and it left me satisfied. If you haven't began the Dom Wars Series yet, you are missing out on one of the BEST series' ever written and no, I'm not exaggerating. Dom Wars is Lucian's first work of fiction but you will never know it by reading it. Lucian is taking the literary world by storm and there is nothing they can do about it except hold on tight and experience the power of The Ineffable Dom.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Just when I thought it couldn't get any better", "unixReviewTime": 1402790400, "reviewTime": "06 15, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "AM1ETH3BLT91T", "asin": "B00KZMICVW", "reviewerName": "Shanyn Doan", "helpful": [14, 15], "reviewText": "Up until now, Dom Wars has been, mostly, about two things:  Lucian and Tara&#8217;s relationship and sex.  There&#8217;s a lot of nuance to both of those and a lot of layers, but if you had to boil the major themes down to two things, these would be them.  We&#8217;ve watched Lucian and Tara come together and form this incredible relationship; they&#8217;ve been to hell and back in a very short period of time.  And they&#8217;re solid now.  There&#8217;s no more, will she, won&#8217;t she, they are standing together on a rock solid foundation.  Lucian launched a full out assault on every single one of her senses by engaging her entire being through intimacy, and it worked.  So what now?Now the real work begins.  Now we get to see how Lucian becomes the Ineffable Dom.  Now we get to see how reflexes get re-wired.  Now we get to see what happens when two newly born people, still in the process of letting their wings dry, go about learning to fly.Lucian&#8217;s work lies with his relationship with his father.  His reflex is automatic rebellion, no matter the instigation.  His reflex is to default to the inner monologue instilled by his father long ago that he&#8217;s not good enough, not worth enough, not capable enough.  The snake chasing its tail is that cycle of damnation and rebellion.  In order to finish his transformation into the Ineffable Dom, Lucian must first knock that cycle off course and hardwire new reflexes into place.  He has to re-learn how to trust himself on new legs.Round 5 also brings us a new level of Steve.  He goes from the cheery, problem-solving sidekick to a main character in this round when he&#8217;s made to pay penance right along with Lucian and Tara for their rule breaking behavior before Round 4.  Steve brings a wonderful dose of humor to what would otherwise be some pretty painful and uncomfortable situations.Last, but certainly, not least is the Preacher Dom.  Designated to meet out Lucian and Tara&#8217;s punishment for breaking rules, he&#8217;s set up as the bad guy.  He&#8217;s set up in such a way that we shouldn&#8217;t like him.  Shouldn&#8217;t want to know anything about him other than, hopefully, he&#8217;ll leave Lucian and Tara alone.  But I fell head over heels for him.  This man has survived the seven levels of hell through the grace of love and faith and to watch him dole out that faith and that love as lessons instead of punishment is glorious indeed.Lucian Bane has written a pivotal book with Round 5.  This book peels back the faade of pleasure, success and simplicity of competition and exposes the interior framework still under construction.  Exposes the raw nerves and, in the end, the immense power and beauty waiting to be claimed by doing that work.  This Round is well balanced between humor, introspection and some truly lovely (and hot as hell) scenes of intimacy with Lucian and Tara.  Bane continues to have moments of absolute perfection with his writing.  Moments that make me stop and have to re-read entire sections several times just for the sheer joy of it.  Those moments alone are enough to keep me shouting from the rooftops that everyone should read this series.I don&#8217;t know what the final round has in store for our crusaders.  But I do know that as long as their journey continues to be laced through with the same heart, soul and laughter than exist in all the previous rounds, it will be nothing short of epic.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Introspective", "unixReviewTime": 1403568000, "reviewTime": "06 24, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A6T2H2PGVB8OB", "asin": "B00KZOQ0L4", "reviewerName": "Dedra", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "Love adventure and mystery with a little romance and humor?

And, as surprising as it may be, she had never experienced real life spankings or any of the other fun and kinky things that fill her stories. However, Dana's vivid imagination, keen research abilities, and general interest were enough to keep her busy. Dana's friend Carla had other plans for her and had been matchmaking behind the scenes. When Dana met Richard for the first time - he had a completely unfair - but totally sexy advantage. Not only had Carla shared lots of information that only best friends usually have - but she also gave Richard all of Dana's books to read. Richard knows full well what Dana thinks she likes and he is more than willing to engage in some kinky escapades. The real question is whether or not Dana's rich fantasy life can really translate into a reality.I would classify this book as a romance with light domestic discipline, light age play and some anal play. Most of the spanking scenes are mild, some are playful - but I wouldn't characterize any of them as harsh. Also, there are plenty of spankings for readers to enjoy. There was a more intense m&eacute;nage scene - but if for some reason that isn't your thing -it turned out to be a dream anyway. My favorite part of the book was watching Dana's relationship with Richard unfold. Richard is an awesome leading man for a kinky romance.

Her last night of irresponsibility.Tyler Blue and his up and coming band, Blue, is required to marry, or at least settle down in a steady relationship. Fans demand it, so his contract demands it, too. The thing is, he doesn&#8217;t want to. Tyler is a player on the outside but just likes to have fun when not in the spotlight.Tyler likes the new caterer. Sherry thinks Tyler is a Blue roadie.

So far all she's left with is a broken heart, though I like that she never really gives up on love.Just one more crazy weekend in Vegas and then Sherry's had it. She wants her happily ever after, which means no more bad boys and hello nice guys. What she didn't count for though was waking up and married, let alone to country superstar Tyler Blue. Sherry doesn't even like country music.The last thing Tyler Blue wanted was a girlfriend, let alone a wife. While he's not okay with the idea, his publicist and management think otherwise. Him being married is apparently a PR dream come true. Now Tyler just has to convince Sherry to play his wife a little while longer.From that first page the attraction between them is obvious, that's what got them in trouble in the first place. There is this click and easiness between them, that is just plain swoon worthy. Playing pretend isn't easy, when slowly real feelings are involved. I liked how it all developed, there is that chemistry but things turn pretty naturally into something more. Tyler and Sherry spend time together and live together, there is bound to be some feelings involved. It's impossible to deny, now they just have to figure out what to do with them.Sherry and Tyler are great characters.

Over time, they teach each other they each are strong and can weather any storm.January Cooper is known as the rich girl, the spoiled girl, the girl who gets everything she wants. And she seems to live up to those perceptions. But underneath, she's a vulnerable young woman who rarely gets what she wants, and what she most wants is someone to love and accept her for her. When her father is arrested for orchestrating a Ponzi scheme, things go from bad the worse.Christian Cutlass is a damaged young man. Once a promising young hockey player, he lost everything he most cared about in one night. He now drowns his guilt in work, school, and alcohol. When January comes into his bar one night, Christian's life is irrevocably changed.I really enjoyed watching as January and Christian became friends, and not friends, and back again. There seemed to be miscommunication between them as they each tried to stay away from the other but there was snarky banter that made it entertaining. I liked that their relationship wasn't going to be perfect but they seemed to be exactly what the other needed. And the emotional growth and healing they brought about in each other was touching.I liked this story and the characters so much. However, I felt there were a few threads in the story that were either left somewhat unresolved or resolved in an unsatisfying way. One thread, involving a character named Vanessa, seemed more important that the resolution it received. I also didn't like the way in which events with January's parents culminated. I know they were selfish and greedy people but to have treated January the way the did seemed a tad unrealistic (maybe because I'm a parent who can't fathom it) and it made for too tidy an ending.I don't know if Ms. Bell plans on giving us more of January and Christian's story but I certainly wouldn't mind. As I said, I liked these characters quite a bit and maybe I'd get a better resolution for January's parents' story, as well as for Vanessa.

Picking up a book by an author you've never read before is a real toss up. You never really know what you're going to get. Well, what I got, I LOVED. Audrey Bell writes exactly the way I love my books to be written. Smart. Clever. Witty. Unpredictable. Real. This book is funny. I don't know if it was supposed to be funny, but it is. The writing is sarcastic and snarky and so full of humor, I laughed out loud more times than I could count. The characters are just so real, their dialogue so authentic. This story is original, refreshing... perfect. While the blurb is just vague enough to allow a reader to assume this story could potentially be clich&eacute;, it's anything but. You've never heard this story before.January Cooper is a child of privilege. She's a spoiled, self-absorbed Harvard student whose biggest worry is what designer shoes to wear on any given day. But the author nailed the development of this character. Reading the story through January's point of view, I, as the reader, didn't know how self-absorbed she actually was. The author crafted this story in such a way that I could never really decide if she was actually a self-centered brat, or if she was actually just very right about all of the crappy people she constantly talked crap about behind their back. January is obviously wealthy and spoiled and of the mindset that she  has been the perpetual victim of a crappy family, crappy boyfriends, crappy friends. But is she? Or is she just so wrapped up in herself that she fails to see things as they really are? Maybe a little of both. Maybe a lot of both.I loved Christian Cutlass. He's no-nonsense. No crap. Every word out of his mouth, I just wanted to devour. He's the perfect male hero because he's just so darn real. He doesn't say all the right things, do all the right things. He's real enough to make mistakes, enough mistakes to tick off the reader and add a decent amount of angst to this story, which I love. He's just a genuine guy, trying to navigate through a really crappy course of events that have altered his life forever. And when his broken world collides with January's collapsing one, it isn't all clich&eacute; rainbows and sunshine. Together, their dynamic is just perfect. Perfectly imperfect, really, as they fight each other, fight themselves, all the while developing an unlikely friendship and an even greater understanding of each other amidst their growing attraction.This story is told in alternating first person points of view... my favorite kind of thing. I love getting inside the heads of these characters, knowing exactly who they are even though the other character has no idea. Their inner monologue is just as witty and humorous as their dialogue. My only criticism of this story is how rushed some scenes felt to me. It wasn't a significant rush, but just enough to leave me wanting more detail, stopping briefly to reread a few sentences to try to figure out what I just missed. But never enough to remove me from the storyline... which was consistently well paced. This is an extremely well written story of love, loss, and self discovery.

Overall I thought it was a good read I would give it 3.5 stars if I could. I thought that the banter and arguing between January and Christian was just enough to be defined as a relationship where they challenge one another without getting tiresome. Their relationship overall worked well and developed nicely. The things that did bother me though were the fact that January comes off as a high strung, air head snob and I feel like she never completely shakes that. Her background seems so underdeveloped we don't know what she's studying at Harvard, what she wants to do/dreams if doing, or is she a good student (unlike Love Show which had a very realistic college feel (I am in college so I can vouch)). We get briefly that she rides horses but she never seems passionate about it and it's a brief blimp. I think January does change for the better by the end of the novel but the way that she's presented in the beginning really never leaves her character and maybe it's the lack of background that does it.I also had to get over what I sort of saw as a plot flaw with Christian (hockey playing boyfriend some I'm up to speed on this information). When you're drafted into the NHL, unless you're one of the top three players (even these aren't guarantees) picked you don't go straight into the NHL (of course exceptions are made made on the basis of what the teams need(looking at you Sidney Crosby)). But lots of teams want the players they draft to stay in college or with their junior teams and continue to develop for at least another year otherwise they would probably be playing with their minor league team. I just felt it was a flaw in the opening with Christian and Sam. The rest of the things pertaining to hockey were great though because lots of other novels I've read get them wrong.I was also disappointed by the way it ended. There seemed to be no true climax and the Epilogue really didn't offer much. I would have liked to see it be a few years later as opposed to a few months.

It's a beautiful story, beautifully told, that unfolds gradually, just as MC Jade's world is crumbling around her.  But that process of destruction is also a process of creation, as each seemingly crushing blow contains within in the seeds of the next stage of Jade's journey.  What I really loved most about this book was the way it describes that astonishing, reason-overwhelming experience of being consumed by the irrational emotional experience of falling in love, inappropriately, wildly and inexplicably, even to the person undergoing it. That crazy feeling of &#34;I know this is a bad idea, why is it so compelling?&#34;There are several other elements of this book that really stand out for me as well.  First, the portrayal of Jade's world of finance and deal-making.  Many writers attempt to depict this world - there's no shortage of sexy CEO's, bad-ass billionaires, and make-believe moguls in the realm of romance and women's fiction. But few, if any, have the verisimilitude and believability of Christine's portrayal of Jade's world.  From the boardroom encounters to the painstaking process of document review, her familiarity with the setting, and her ease at recreating it bring the background to life.Another element I loved is the way Christine uses the seasons and elements of the natural world as metaphors.  Okay, that's maybe not the most original thing in the world, but that's a fault more of my description, because her use of it is fresh and always apropos. Allusions to the natural world enhance the emotional impact of the story, as well as move the narrative along.Finally, I want to just touch briefly on Christine's eloquent style - she has a lovely gift for a memorable insightful phrase that lights up the story like brief flashes of lightning.  You'll find your highlighting finger working overtime as you discover them.  Here's an early on example that draws in the seasons, too:I found love in the summer and then lost it in the spring.  I cried myself to sleep in the winter and froze my heart with the soft tumble of the snow.Lovely, really.  And although at this point in the book it's just foreshadowing, it serves a narrative as well as poetic purpose.Christine's skill as a storyteller and writer has matured with each of her novels, and here in Insipid she has really hit her stridee.

This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.Her Imaginary Lover by Doris O&#8217;Connor grabbed my attention from the blurb and I crossed my fingers that it would live up to the expectations set by this intriguing blurb. I am so happy to report that Her Imaginary Lover was everything I hoped it would be. Ms. O&#8217;Connor impressed me with her creativity and imagination.Macie Johann has been blind since birth but she&#8217;s never let her disability stop her; until one night when she is attacked on her way home by men taking advantage of her blindness.  Macie is rescued by a muscle bound hunk that seems familiar. Her savior turns out to be her childhood imaginary friend, Kaylom. Turns out he&#8217;s not imaginary, but he&#8217;s not exactly human either. Macie knows that Kaylom and she are meant to be together but there are so many obstacles to a happy ending.Macie was a fascinating character and I loved how her blindness was not used as an obstacle but instead just a part of her such as her hair color or height. Being unable to see did not hinder her determination to win Kaylom and did not detract from her inner strength. Macie was a smart, independent woman with a successful career. It was very easy to cheer for her to find love.Kaylom was everything you would want in an imaginary friend, but as a real life lover he exceeded my hopes. In addition to being well built, strong and alpha, he was protective of Macie and willing to sacrifice his own happiness in order to ensure her health and safety. I think I fell in love with Kaylom almost immediately and wanted nothing more for this couple to be together.I was so enthralled with Her Imaginary Lover that I read and finished the book in one sitting. The book had everything I could want in a romance novel - original storyline, fascinating characters and hot sex. Ms. O&#8217;Connor really knows how to write steamy sex scenes that are off the charts hot but still include love and caring that raises the lovemaking to another level.Her Imaginary Lover is a novella coming in at about 75 pages which is my only complaint because I wasn&#8217;t ready to say goodbye to Kaylom and Macie.

Just when you think The Coalition couldn&#8217;t get more sinister, another character pulls us into their story and evokes such empathy from the reader.Orion and Bruno&#8217;s love story is actually quite bittersweet. To have two people fall in love the way they do &#8211; pure and unabashed love &#8211; in the midst of such turmoil shows Sarah knows how to make a reader feel.

She has good friends too, but none of them truly understand the horror that Holly lives each day with her inability to be touched and her nightmares where she relives the event.Holly&#8217;s friends convince her to go to a concert with them to see the Renegades.

Little did Holly know that at this concert she was going to meet someone that had the potential to change her life&#8230;Drew Walker is an egotistical, tattooed, gorgeous, lead singer of The Renegades and the guy that has the potential to ROCK Holly's world.  During the concert Holly inadvertently meets Drew in a field when she was trying to avoid the crowd.  She had no idea that he was in the band, let alone the lead singer, all she knew is that his touch didn&#8217;t bother her and she wanted to understand why.The instant connection between Holly and Drew was amazing, they have a hot, sexual tension that cannot be denied by either of them no matter how hard they try.  With Holly&#8217;s past and Drew&#8217;s fears of commitment, they have many hurdles to overcome if they want a relationship together.Between the tension from Holly&#8217;s overprotective brother, her caring friends, and Drew's drama; this book is a roller coaster of emotion.

In an effort to integrate the aliens, a special school is formed that both EVES and Gutters attend. This story follows the lives of Victoria, an alien hater, and three royal aliens on their quest for acceptance, friendship, and to prevent war. This is a major cliff hanger, so be prepared!This was an excelled book. Victoria is mouthy, strong, and has so much more to offer than what meets the eye. This is the same for the other main characters. There is so much more than appearances. I loved that the book was fascinating, enchanting, and had a bit of rawness to it. This book is suitable for the mature young adult population, and I was happy with the underlying moral compass it had. It was the perfect book to discover that you should never judge a book by its cover. People should be judged on their behavior and what's in their hearts instead of what other people tell you to believe because of race, color, or gender.I enjoyed all of the characters; even the evil ones.

Her mother is concerned; her father is off on another campaign trip for the up-coming election. We learn quickly that Mira has a gift (or curse). Whenever someone makes skin contact with her, she receives an instant zap of all their memories. The only person immune to her powers is her father.We enter Mira's world, one with a loving mother, never home father and a body guard on constant alert. Mira's life is lonely and due to her ability, she's cut herself off from everyone even more. I'll admit, I wondered where her friends might be or at least, loose acquaintances. But at least, she does run into a wonderfully sweet guy, who accompanies her on this journey (one which her father doesn't instantly approve of, of course.)It was interesting to watch a main character who absolutely hates their ability. Often characters may not like it, but they at least try to use it to their advantage every now and then, where Mira does not. She also attempts to seek professional help and is willing to open up to Dr. Walsh, which was also a nice and interesting twist. Even better, Dr. Walsh believes her, an act which doesn't completely shut Mira out from the world.I found the inner-contrast in Mira very interesting. She's willing to try to commit suicide twice to escape her ability, but on the other hand, is a strong person, ready to take on a powerful opponent when the need arises. She has strengths and weaknesses, both which make her a very sympathetic and realistic character.The world and plot surrounding Mira deepens quickly, making the story run along at a nice pace. There's plenty of emotion, mystery and adventure, which tended to remind me of scenes from the movie Die Hard. I couldn't help but smile at the end chase---although it was really tense!I had no problem connecting to the characters and was glad to see a hero, who is heroic without being overly dashing, overly strong, or overly anything. He's simply sweet, nice and totally lovable.In other words, I recommend this to YA Urban Fantasy fans, who like a bit of romance (but not too hot), a mystery with twists and turns, and actions scenes with a few explosions.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A Nice Twist", "unixReviewTime": 1404345600, "reviewTime": "07 3, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A12Q8MINR3GIU6", "asin": "B00L4S73JS", "reviewerName": "JustJen", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "I am a huge fan of this series. I mean, what&#8217;s not to love? Hot as hell Marines mixed with more hot as hell Shifters &#8211; ooooh-freaking-rah!In this installment, Adam, the human civilian contractor, drives convoy trucks for the Marine base. He has friends on the base who are shifters, but he really doesn&#8217;t know or understand much about them. His friends are trying to teach him though, especially once he meets Dawson, who comes to the base to assess and handle the resident shifter pack.Dawson and Adam take a liking to each other, and boy do they turn up the heat! Dawson is one hot, sexy, dirty talking wolfie. And, he backs it up out of the bedroom as well, implementing change and making things right after he ousts the current pack leader who has basically been using and abusing the humans.As expected, Ms. McKenna is spot on with her military details. The lingo and combat action is very realistic and really sets the tone for life on an outpost base. The fighting with the wolves was exciting as well and really makes you feel as though it were a normal every day possibility to have a pack of wolves assisting every platoon. The sex scenes were hot, and the action fast-paced and exciting.It did feel a little strange that Adam was so clueless about the wolves, given he was working with them every day, and the fact that his brother is mated to, oh, not just any old wolf, but the True Alpha of all the wolves! I understand Adam and Tim weren&#8217;t very close, but you would still think he would know a little more about the wolf goings on than he did. I was happy to see the brothers come together when it was needed and to see them get past a few of their issues.  It also felt a little off that the mate issue wasn&#8217;t really brought up until it was needed to keep Adam from being sent home.  Seemed rather anticlimactic.  There are no actual &#8220;I love you&#8217;s&#8221; here, but there is plenty of puppy loving and affection to show how much these guys care.I didn&#8217;t love nearly as much as the first book, but definitely more than the last.

I had no idea who would be the characters or what the story would cover.  I didn't care because I trust the author to tell me a good story and she most certainly did that.  I love the shifter culture, the military connection, the nuances that are small, but important, the character development, the plot movement and of course the partnerings that take place.I would recommend that these be read in order for understanding of the worldbuilding, backdrop and ongoing minor plot threads.  Both characters are introduced in the last book and something of their personalities and place in the series is established.  I was actually surprised by whose story this is as I was expecting two other characters to be next.  I confess that Adam Madison was not my favorite person in the last book and I was extremely curious how the author would win me over to him.This story in some ways begins in the previous book because Adam Madison is the brother of one of the previous main characters and Dawson Rivers is on the same executive staff as Adam's brother, Tim.  Adam is a sullen, angry person that strikes out at his brother any chance he gets in a misguided transfer of guilt over their younger brother's murder.  Adam is also resentful because he believes that everyone loves Tim and he's the perfect brother/son while Adam is just the second-rate one.  He bristles at anything he considers a hint that someone might connect him with Tim or his overwrought suspicions that Tim is checking up on him.  He wraps his grief and anger around him like a cloak keeping himself isolated from other people until recently.  Adam is a civilian driver stationed at the marine base and is contracted to drive convoy runs to deliver supplies to other bases.  It's a dangerous job, but he likes it.  He keeps his cool and has earned some respect even amongst a group of marine werewolves he has tentatively reached out to as friends.Unfortunately, not all the wolves are honorable marines including the base pack alpha and his cronies who make life a misery for humans and submissive wolves.  They get off on having the power to mistreat others.  Word finally leaks out to Noah, the true alpha and he sends in Dawson Rivers his Omega to get the situation under control hopefully through diplomacy and education.  Only the situation is worse than they thought so Dawson has to take a more pro-active role.Adam has had an embarrassing crush on Dawson since he met him while visiting his brother Tim back in San Diego.  So he is particularly sensitive of Dawson's presence and that Dawson seems to always be nearby.  Adam is suspicious and resentful at first thinking that Dawson is there to check up on him, but then he adds anger to his tumble of emotion because he can't stand the way the werewolves bully with their strength.Adam soon starts to see that he has Dawson wrong, the werewolves as a race wrong and even starts to sense that he's got even more wrong particularly when it comes to his brother and his family.  Adam had kept himself deliberately ignorant of werewolf culture as a misguided bit of his resentment to his brother and now he needs a crash course in all things werewolf quick.  He needs to understand what is happening amongst the pack wolves and for sure what is going on between him and Dawson.  What he thought was just a casual fling seems to mean more to Dawson and if he is honest to him too.Things come to a head with the bullying wolves, the insurgent activity along the convoy routes, Adam getting over his personal issues and the relationship between Adam and Dawson and that was before Adam gets taken captive.  Life as he knew it just got a whole lot more precious and he is forcibly made to know every second that it might all be over.Okay, so Adam Madison...yeah, he was pretty much the same putz guy that was introduced in the book before and this time I got a front row seat since he's doing the narrating.  He is so ugly toward his brother and is pretty self-absorbed.  His resentment is to the point that he disassociates from being related to his brother and freaks out at the thought of someone coming on base who knows Tim and will speak of Adam's relationship to Tim.  He barks at even his friends if they show any respect or appreciation for his brother.Then there is his unreasonable assumptions about the werewolves in general.  He has three good friends and he knows the wolves back home and yet he is so caught up in his anger that he doesn't think to speak up about the injustices going on at the base and would rather blame all wolves than see the issue for what it was.  When Dawson tries to draw close to him and shows an interest, Adam spends much of the relationship with one foot in the doorway ready to bounce denying there is a relationship and denying the truth of their mutual interest.  See?  Not much to like here.And if he had remained the same for the whole book, I would have felt such pity for Dawson or at least questioned his intelligence to want a guy like that.  However, Dawson saw something in Adam that Adam didn't even see.  Dawson was the catalyst Adam needed to get his business together and see things differently.  He stopped filtering everything through his internal issues so everything was no longer something to react in anger or resentment to.  By the end of the book, he was a guy that was worth it.  I know these are tough marine types and on top of that there is the whole family forgives and receives back prodigals, but I was disappointed that Adam's change of heart didn't include more restitution.  He had been so ugly to people particularly Tim that I wanted to hear the words.The action plot is a series of snapshot scenes of life on the base and its environs.  The situation with the sadistic wolves was an interesting thread as were the scenes of Adam out on the road in those intense convoy missions.  The capture situation was intense because Adam had no idea what his fate would be and because the author made me as the reader feel right there in the moment as the isolation, boring days and situation as a captive were well-drawn.The romance is gritty and rough.  These guys like to talk dirty and just go at with little finesse and tenderness.  You won't hear sentimentality and some stuff isn't put into words, but is just assumed.  This suits this pair, the circumstances, and the setting.And just an observation, I enjoy how each book offers up a different set of circumstances, settings and personalities even though the books have a nice cohesiveness.  The stories aren't formulaic yet I can count on strong military and werewolf actions scenes, werewolf culture and strong characters in the wolf/human pairings.As I wrap-up, I again find myself looking forward with great anticipating for the next book in the series.  I hope it is Terrell's, but hey, I'll go with it if it's not.  I enjoyed the experience of the author working her magic and making me eventually enjoy Adam and his story with the delectable Dawson of the Lilac eyes.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A difficult, resentful human and a peacemaking werewolf in another strong entry to this paranormal military romance", "unixReviewTime": 1403222400, "reviewTime": "06 20, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A1NPILAVTZ6ZJJ", "asin": "B00L4S73PM", "reviewerName": "Johnnie-Marie Howard", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "This story felt to be a 2person POV which in a way was really great we got to see the DOM side of things and the SUB side of things not only that but the characters each had there own feelings on things and how they were handled was another great thing the characters had for them; besides all the hott sex and love that they shown each other.

I mean we never get a resolution for the vampire blood poisoning so they can never speak telepathically.  Then they poisoned further.  That was a sore spot for me.  I was also upset that we didn't hear more about the ex-alpha's plans until very late in the story after he was kidnapped.  We still didn't get much.  Also, how could they have traced the poison to the wolves and not realize that it was originating from their own coven.  I mean no offense but DUH.  How did it take someone from the outside to realize that they must have an inside leak.  Parts of the book just seemed so very convoluted.  Also, how is it that his mother never made and appearance in this book.  She obviously played a big role in the overall scheme and was abusing her own children.  How was her involvement not developed and explained further.  What was she gaining?  If they killed men that abused him, why not the mother?  I just think the story was not developed as much because it was going in so many directions.  If there is going to be an ongoing nemesis, more needs to be explained about the reasons behind it all.  I mean the guy that kidnapped the vampire's mate didn't seem to have a real reason.  I mean why poison men you say you wanted to mate with.Anyway, now I am just ranting, but you get my point.

After a passionate one night stand with Logan, a government investigator posing as a bartender, Cass learns she is pregnant.

Their quasi-professional relationship evolves into much more, as they learn about each other and learn to forgive the mistakes of their past.Cass and Logan are extremely likeable, have great chemistry and challenge each other in the most unique ways. I immediately connected to them as individuals and as a couple. Their sex scenes are lustful and full of promise. Olivia, Cass and Logan's toddler, has some very funny laugh out loud moments.

Everyone deals with it differently.&#8221;Logan Knight is struggling to deal with the scars that he has returned with, plagued with nightmares and struggling with P.T.S.D, all he wants to do is set up his ranch as a safe place for other veterans to spend time at, and to be able to convalesce and receive the best help and support they can for their issues. Two things are standing in his way &#8211; his father and his lack of a wife.Becky Holmes is in trouble, caring for a young baby is struggle enough, but she&#8217;s recently lost her mother to cancer, and her ex has just been released from prison. His time spent behind bars because she called the cops on him, and refused to take the blame for the hit and run accident he drove away from whilst she was in the car.Logan and his family name offer her the protection and the stability she needs in order to fight a custody battle for her daughter. The daughter her ex never wanted, but is now using as his way to punish her for sending him to jail. A deal is struck, a contract is signed, and they agree to a mutually beneficial marriage, Logan gets his ranch, and Becky keeps custody of baby Sophie as well as having the powerful Knight Family as her allies.I loved the sentiment between Logan and Becky in this book, they are emotionally scarred from things that have happened in their past, they are wary of each other initially and the emotions they are feeling, even though the chemistry is there, neither wants to rush headlong into something that they don't quite understand themselves.Becky &#8211; &#8220;When you touch me, I feel safe, sexy and whole.&#8221;Logan &#8211; &#8220;When I touch you, it all gets easier. Kissing you today was like that blanket &#8211; warm, soft and giving me a little protection.&#8221;The bravery displayed by both of them in different ways, to push past their long held and deeply-rooted fears, so they are able to embrace something new together, in spite of the odds, interfering families and demented exes makes for a really enjoyable and heart-warming story.She had the power to shove back the ugliness inside of him, the memories and the failures that shadowed his soul.Although there isn&#8217;t really anything new offered up in the way of storyline, this second book in the Once A Marine Series, offers us another extremely hot leading man, a likeable, strong and sassy heroine, mix that with a little bit of suspense, a whole lot of sexyness and you are onto a winner, with a well written and easy to absorb book. I look forward to reading more books in this series in the future.&#8221;You&#8217;re turning me and my world inside out.

Unfortunately a mix-up at the hotel means one room and one bed. The two friends figure that they can suck it up for one night. But then they wake up in each other&#8217;s arms, seconds away from taking their relationship to the next level. They decide to follow through on that impulse, vowing that they&#8217;ll forget the fling when they go home. But then Joe falls hard for Drea. Can he convince her that what happens in Buenos Aires doesn&#8217;t have to stay there?I really liked the awkwardness between Joe and Drea when they try to discuss their relationship. It was realistic. I would have been pretty suspicious if either Drea or Joe admitted to having feelings for the other right away. I would&#8217;ve wondered why neither of them acted on them before heading to Argentina. I especially liked the situations where one misinterpreted what the other was saying. It not only made things more awkward, but it also made the person responding struggle with a response.The setting in Buenos Aires was both positive and a negative. Setting the story in a foreign country, especially in South America, let Drea and Joe feel comfortable separating their friendship at home from this new romantic relationship. It also gave them the sense that the romance stayed in Argentina. I really liked that aspect of the setting.But I didn&#8217;t get the feeling that the author had ever been to Buenos Aires. While visiting a setting before writing about it isn&#8217;t necessary, convincing the reader that the author didn&#8217;t just flip through a guidebook is important. The setting was too superficial for me. I struggled to get lost in the setting and to believe that I was reading about Buenos Aires. All of the activities that Joe and Drea did seemed like they were either found in a tourist guide book or looked up online. That bothered me. It really took me out of the story.I&#8217;d recommend One Night in Buenos Aires to a reader looking for a short romance that doesn&#8217;t shy away from the awkwardness of friends becoming lovers.Rating: 4/5One Night in Buenos Aires by Amanda K.

Jon, however, is redeemed a little here, but if he witnessed even HALF the things claimed by the author in this book, and has not made an effort to take custody of ALL OF HIS CHILDREN away from this woman, then he is no better than she. He could very easily call upon former babysitters, volunteers, TLC staffers, the list goes on and on, as witnesses in his custody case testify on his behalf.

I couldn't wait for this book to come out. But I felt I didn't get what we were told we were going to get. Which was Dorothy and Hawk's story. This whole book felt like a moment, a day in the life and what a grim day it was. Gone was the epic sweep of MS books past....the laughs, the crazy out of control-ness, the zany personalities....it was kitchen sink grim. And not a heck of a lot happened either. It was mostly a coming to terms moment for the main characters involved--D, Hawk and Jace. Each one of these characters had long moments of thought to themselves about the crossroads they were facing, the lessons they'd learned, the choices they needed to make. But it just didn't make for gripping, exciting, intriguing reading. And Jace's scenes weren't terribly interesting, I didn't care about him so much, not invested. I was greedy for Hawk and D!!! No such satisfaction, though.  We found out about Hawk's background, and then a choice he and Deuce made for the good of the club and......that was it. Really. Yep, we saw black hearted ZZ (sigh) and that story line continues on until we get to his book.My red hot disappointment lies in the fact that we don't get to see how it all began with Hawk and Dorothy. When that secret relationship was revealed in a previous book, it was a TOTAL mindblower, it was fantastic! I was dying from then to see how it got started...to live all that hot, secret intensity between these two. How he \"forced\" her, how she couldn't say no to him, how he was a good dad through it all, etc, etc...(Ach, don't get me started!) Did we get those scenes here, the book dedicated to these two wonderful characters?? Nope. I still can't believe it!  Instead we get recollections, thinking, more thinking, pondering, deciding, declaring...all rather passive and tedious after the beginning excitement wore off.Yes, it is MS so it is well written and emotional. But it's all thinking, pondering and deciding and a lot less wild and funky. And no, it's not because \"they're older now.\" So what? I wanted to live Hawk and Dorothy like we've vibrantly lived the other couples' stories in all the previous books. But we don't get to. Why, Madeline??

Forces her to face her past.Throughout this story, we get some past information that we hadn't learned, along with ALOT of new.

You become and attract what you think and believe. As such,  I try and read anything I can on the Law of Attraction.

This one excerpt pretty well sums it all up, &#8220;By visualizing what you truly want in life, then putting forth your positive energy to get it, you truly can manifest your destiny&#8212; drawing and attracting the wealth, love, and/ or happiness you desire.&#8221;There are many examples of famous people we all know outlined in this book.

It does take considerable effort to make The Law work for you simple because most of us have to re-train our brain around this concept and rid ourselves of negativity and improper thought &#8211; easier said than done.In conclusion, if you have a desire to change your life for the positive or even have a desire to learn about the Law of Attraction I would highly recommend this book.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Using the Law of Attraction to build the life you want!", "unixReviewTime": 1404432000, "reviewTime": "07 4, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A19W7AT2DYSIDM", "asin": "B00L9L8H2M", "reviewerName": "Marnie", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "Knitting for experts book is a great guide to advanced knitting skills improvement and upgraded stitch ideas.

Flick is in a cab, on her way to a date, when the cab breaks down in a bad and secluded neighborhood.  The battery is dead on her cell phone so she decides to stop in a bar to use their phone.  She is warned before she enters the bar, by an unseen man, that she should walk away and NOT enter the bar.  She refuses to listen. This being the first of many future instructions given by Rushe that Flick will ignore. Flick enters the bar and immediately realizes her mistake.  The men in the bar are having a meeting. They are not good men.  She is not welcome.  Four of the men capture and whisk her off to a secluded cabin.  One of her captives is Rushe. What follows is a non stop page turning dark gritty read.  There is a lot of sex, and yes it was good.  Both Flick and Rushe were likable characters.  Rushe is a very Alpha male.  Flick is a strong but vulnerable woman.  She has never felt appreciated or cared for.  These two together made a great couple.  If you are a fan of dark erotic reads, this book will be right up your alley.  This book is well written with non stop action and emotion.  So, why the 4 star rating and not a 5 star rating?  Two reasons.  One, I actually thought there was too much sex, although it was well written and very good.  Two, I thought Flick fell for Rushe too quickly.

I gave it the benefit of the doubt and took a chance.  The title intrigued me enough to read it.  This is the first book I&#8217;ve read by Stephanie Witter.  I will be totally honest.  I had some mixed reviews on this one.  I liked the storyline and where it could have gone but I found it jumping around some.  I couldn&#8217;t follow it sometimes.London Reed is in her second year at UCLA and is in need of a new place to stay.  She doesn&#8217;t want to go back to living with her parents.  She came to her last apartment for the day in her search and it was 2B. When she gets to the door she finds a tear stained faced girl and a guy who liked like he didn&#8217;t care standing there.  It turns out this cocky guy owned the apartment.  That didn&#8217;t stop London.  This is where she wanted to live.  She may get herself into trouble but nothing was going to stop her.London doesn&#8217;t let anyone get to her and she will tell you exactly how she sees it.  She is a girl with no filter.  She finds it hard to let any guy get close to her heart.  There is something about Byron that she can&#8217;t help but to fight.Byron Davis is a student at UCLA looking for a roommate but he doesn&#8217;t want a girl.  Against his better judgment he gave London a two month trial period.  He was a playboy who could have any women he wanted.  He had a different girl in his bed all the time.  All he wanted was a one night stand and then he would kick them out in the morning&#8230;until London.  She had this draw to her that made him feel again.  He was a solider that had some terrible things happen to him while he was deployed.  It hurt him deeply and his walls went up afterwards.  He didn&#8217;t let people get close to him and he was a changed man after that.  London, without even knowing started to bring the old Byron out again.  He did have one rule.  Don&#8217;t ask him about his time in the Army.He often found himself jealous of London and her ex-boyfriend Ryan.  He often thought she was going to get back together with him.  So in return he set out to hurt her.  The end result was they both ended up hurting each other.  Finally he let himself open up to her and laid it all out on the line and expressed his true feelings.  London being London left him hanging.I often didn&#8217;t understand their actions towards one another.  I felt like I was shaking my head a lot and thinking &#8220;Do people really act like this&#8221;.  I then it hit me and yes they do.

The story had a lot of potential but I found it extremely frustrating.Byron was promiscuous, to say the least. Even after deciding that he liked London, he constantly had females in his bedroom. But he didn't think it was okay for London to have any guys around. He was such a hypocritical tool! And he was always saying to London, \"You didn't just say that,\" after she would say something that he deemed guy-like. Yes, she did! I think it was so frustrating because what she was saying wasn't that uncommon for women to say. I hear girls talk like that all the time.London bugged me for a whole other set of reasons. A) She didn't want to be \"that girl\" so she didn't say anything about Byron hooking up with other girls even after there were very strong indications of mutual interest between her and Byron, if you know what I mean. She should prefer being \"that girl\" to the one that lets some guy disrespect her. B) She constantly assumed she knew what Byron was thinking, so she kept making idiotic decisions. C) Every time she hooked up with a guy, it was to make Byron jealous. Grow up! (I know, she's only 19, but that's just so petty and unsatisfying. What's the point of hooking up if you're not even enjoying yourself?!)I felt London's weight was addressed too much. Even when she was relaxing with her best friend, she was described as crossing her chubby arms over her chest. Usually when weight is addressed this much in a book, it's eventually discussed in a positive light later on, but that didn't happen here (at least that I can remember).I would have also liked to get the rest of the story behind the Ryan situation. London discussed in it a very vague way that left me wondering what exactly he did to her.I think this book could benefit from an editor. Spelling and grammar weren't horrible here, but there were several times where words were obviously misused (not misspelled). It was very distracting for me. I would literally stop and debate with myself about whether or not things were spelled wrong or whether the author deliberately used that word (e.g., bare feet paddled across the floor instead of padded). I know a lot of people can ignore that sort of thing but I got caught up on it.Like I said, I liked the story line and I'm not opposed to reading more of Stephanie Witter's work.

She initially appears and disappears rather frequently, much to Donovan&#8217;s consternation.

This book was definitely my favorite of the two written thus far.The mythology is much more developed in this book with much more significance given to it.  There are a lot of twists and turns and unexpected moments in this book that truly change the course of the book.  There are characters from the first book that play much more important roles now, while others move to the background a little bit.We learn a lot more about the past and the brothers' connections to it, as well as some surprising information about Mari's world, too.  In the end, she finds help in the last place she ever thought she would, although whether or not the help is true is a question that we just don't have an answer to!The one thing that truly bothers me with this book, however, still has to do with emphasis paid to certain parts of the plot.  There is a whole lot of action on Mari's part without a lot of respect to the well-known fact that messing with the events of the past significantly affect the future.  There doesn't seem to be a whole lot of attention paid to that concept by Mari and her friends.  Nor do they seem to spend much time trying to understand what the goddess needs them to do, instead focusing on their own needs.  This is something that directly flies in the face of the goddess' issues with children of time.  It will be interesting to see how this plays out.Things to love...--The blend of created mythology and ancient history.--The stronger emphasis placed on the sci-fi/time travel.Things I wanted more/less of...--More understanding of what it is that they are supposed to be doing with the time travel.My Recommendation:  The story line of the overall series is much more developed in this book and I think the story will continue to grow!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Better sequel!", "unixReviewTime": 1405900800, "reviewTime": "07 21, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A3GE49878POZQ1", "asin": "B00LAPR22I", "reviewerName": "Delilah Roman", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "I was not impressed with this series.

The short Novellas are very addictive always leaving you wanting more, which is why it is so good that there is a relatively short time between each publishing.  Spearwood Academy Episodes 9 & 10 are no different, once you have a taste you cannot help but devour it in one sitting!In the last Novel Roseman had gotten into Avalon's mind and replaced her memories, leaving her to believe that he was her father, her childhood was completely different and that she was indeed engaged to be happily married to the Royal who in reality she cannot stand; Paden.  When he lets her go he tells her that her friends will be acting strange for awhile but that they will soon be &#34;back to normal&#34; by the next day.When she wakes up and sees the boys, Avalon is astounded by just how weird the boys are acting around her. None of them understand why she is acting so strange; her choice of clothing is different, the way she is bothered  about her appearance and even references to a Mother (whom she never knew as she abandoned her at birth) who would go mad if she could see her looking so messed up, she has to look pretty for Paden. at this the Boy's know instantly something is very wrong but Avalon just brushes off their concern for her to visit Dr. Quinn (Spearwood Academy DR), she remains insistent that they need to hurry in order to meet up with Paden for breakfast.Paden is shocked to see Avalon arrive for dinner with the boys in tow, especially with the way she is acting towards him, and although it is his greatest wish to have Avalon in his arms, be agreeable to be his wife, does he really want her this way, with no mind of who she truly is? In an unlikely turn of events, Paden decides that certain things are worth more than his social standing - Avalon.  Restoring Avalon's memories is of more importance to him as even though he wishes she would love him, he wants her true love not her false memory induced love.Dante, Amr, Horace, Lusk, Lennox,Bullock, Maerick and Paden all work together in an attempt to rescue Avalon from the mind manipulation that Roseman has put her through - Things are never easy and as the boys find out, that even working together things can be exceptionally dangerous and the game has just gotten deadly...........Deep inside her mind Avalon is barely hanging on by a thread all she knows is that she can hear her own voice making comments to herself , but comments she feels like she wouldn't normally make.... Can the Boys save Avalon before she is gone forever?An amazing edition to the Saga that has again left me wanting more! Again the novel, just like the other previous episodes, 9 & 10 are no different, they are too short; just as you are really getting into it and are full to the brill of excitement and anticipation is suddenly cut short - Cliffhanger Overload!!

It's sad to think that some of the things that happened in this book have probably actually happened in reality.I absolutely loved Elle. She is a bad*ss. Absolutely, on of the best females ever.

Her past keeps coming back but this time she might get closure. There is so much mystery about him and she keeps their secret to herself.

He's damaged from his last mission and traumatized by hallucinations along with being wrongly medicated. A chance encounter with Lacey, a former Walter Reed nurse, and she's saving him. Recognizing his strengths and needs she guides him to the right help. These two connect quickly and passionately.

One is a Senator's daughter and he does more than save her. This one has lots of action, military and otherwise.The Kiss of a Seal: A sweet romance between a tough female trainer and her client.

You really got to pick this book up! I&#8217;m going to say it right now up front. I recommend this book!I&#8217;ve read many menage novels before and really liked them, and can say that this is another one I really, really, &#8212; REALLY loved! If I can I would so make a video review so you can tell how much I enjoyed this book and see all my quirky stupidity over this book.This is Meghan March&#8217;s debut book and I was hooked right from the start &#8212; and I mean the start, like when I first read the synopsis when it was up for a Book blast and review tour, I knew I had to read it. And so here I am finished reading it and now reviewing it for y&#8217;all.Oh my gosh I can not tell you how much I love this! I mean I don&#8217;t want to reiterate the synopsis but man it&#8217;s hard not to do. Teeheehee~ hard.But anyways, the world is like basically heading into a hectic apocalypse, no zombies, just out of electricity, a blackout of sort, reminds me of the TV show Revolution (which is now cancelled by the way) when a plane crashes down in Chicago. We then have Rowan, or Ro, packing up the instant the madness hit and finding her way back home to join her father and sister. Unfortunately she got herself into a bit of a scramble, literally, and is on the run from some mad rapist hillbillies. Of course she gets herself injured by tripping and then rescued by a hunky and intimidating, Conan the barbarian. She gets brought to the safety of his camp and finds herself surrounded by other hunks. Dream come true right? *wink wink*So yeah, things got down and banter flies within the moment she&#8217;s safe inside the in-caged barrier, she did not want to be there. And even though there&#8217;s two hunky men that makes her tingle in excitement, she&#8217;s hell bent determined to get the heck out of there and reunite with her family.Okay, now on to the good stuff. I really liked Ro. She was heck of a heroine and I just couldn&#8217;t not like her. She had never placed her family first on her list because she was such a workaholic that once the apocalypse hit, it made her regret not having spent more time with them. But then her father did prepare her for something of this like so she was shocked that his craziness didn&#8217;t hit far from the truth. She was determined as heck to reach her family and also hell bent on doing things her way. Even to the point of defying the hottie hunky Conan the barbarian, Graham, again and again.  She was strong-minded, stubborn, independent, infuriating, and a not so small of a girl with a size 8 waist. Yup, I liked her. But man can she be full of surprises!  Not just can she argue and ignore the over protectiveness of these men but she can really pull something over their heads, and dare them to sack her. She&#8217;s a heck of a troublemaker for these ex-Marines. Dang! And I like her so much!And then the two hunks. Graham, Conan the barbarian &#8211;from what Ro likes to call him because he likes to man handle her, in a very good and protective way&#8212;, and Zach the gorgeous friendly one. But yes these two are my absolute favorites! I mean they are the heroes but I can&#8217;t tell you who I liked best, gosh! I just wish they were one whole person! But of course they have to be two separate characters and in personalities which works just fine by me, but they are down right sexy. But I got to warn you, these two are just tortured. They&#8217;re both not perfect and had a rough childhood with parents that were just, not there when they need them so they really had a background and trust issues.Graham is the absolute Alpha male every girl who reads romances super love. He&#8217;s the one who likes to take control and is the leader of the pack, so of course he likes control and likes to take control of the situation; which therefore made it difficult for him to handle when Ro was always disobeying his orders. He is the one with the most trust issues because of his childhood and so doesn&#8217;t like to be attached  to people, most likely women so he&#8217;s never into the relationship thing. He can be very tenacious when he finds something that he wants, in the situation it&#8217;s Ro. And he can be very intimidating and can also be very aloof and detached if something emotional gets in the way. Very doubting you know. He&#8217;s the bad boy with all the problems but is very broken inside and sweet and you just want to hug and make everything better for his sake.Zach on the other hand is the total opposite of Graham. He&#8217;s what we would call the Beta hero, but then he&#8217;s not actually the beta neither. But compared to Graham, he would be the beta. And you know me, I super love my Beta heroes! Just saying. But Zach can be very forthcoming and open about what he likes and can really take control of thing if he felt he needed too. He&#8217;s very friendly and flirtatious, I call him the pretty boy type because he knows he oozes everything sex. He&#8217;s the more approachable type and he doesn&#8217;t judge you right off the top and is more trusting and compassionate. He&#8217;s also more in touch with his feelings, which I loved about him because he doesn&#8217;t hide it. He too had a hard childhood but he tend to hide that and see only the good things in life. He&#8217;s the more rational one between him and Graham, while Graham is more action.As I read this though, I felt that Graham had, or seem more of the &#8220;true&#8221; Hero in this book. I felt that he had more parts and we got to understand and see more side of his character, personality, and past than we did Zack. Zach felt like he was just the motivation to bring Graham up to pace with his feelings, although we also saw Zach&#8217;s personality and his role in their relationship he was more, to me, the wing-man.As for the story I really loved how it was written. It wasn&#8217;t written in only one person&#8217;s point of view but in all three, and wasn&#8217;t in first person either which I really liked because I enjoyed reading this kind of story and setting in third person. The interactions between these three were super strong. I was surprised that I wasn&#8217;t turned off by this relationship. I know I had trouble with this kind of genre-ish because I would want each of them to find their own HEA. This is why I like separate books for these two different types of heroes because then I won&#8217;t have to choose who I liked best out of the book because I would know that the other one might get to have their own book and find their own HEA. Butas for this case, they all found it and I liked it.Their interactions were very enjoyable to read and see move along as their relationship grew. Although it grew within a short space of time, like not even within 24 hours &#8212;of course an apocalypse would do that to you I believe&#8212; I was really invested in it. It had me on the edge of my seat and heart racing with every bit of action it gave me. And it had every good bit of action down from man handling to fearing for the lives of peoples and just, fire arms, guns, and lots of action.Oh yeah, every banter and argument Ro and Graham had either got me laughing or thinking of what would happen next. They most definitely got me thinking of what Ro would do next to vex Graham because I just loved vexing him. I super loved it. I also super love how Zach is always reassuring Ro and asking her permission before he does things with and to her. I thought that was very sweet and caring of him to think of her personally first before himself. And he to likes to reassure himself by asking her those questions and to tell him verbally so that he hears it from her mouth what he can and what she wants him to do to her. Getting permission from her, you know, very gentlemanly of him. Whoa~ is he turning out to be a submissive? That just got me thinking. But anyways the sex.Can I just say the sex was amazingly heart stoppingly panty wetting. Oh my gosh, that dang first sexual scene! Ugh~ I&#8217;m not sure why I&#8217;m feeling so vexed but that scene really got me frustrated because I needed some&#8212;thing! I had to skim over the the last sex scene because I couldn&#8217;t deal it with. It was too dang amazingly written I&#8230;.errrr&#8230;..I wanted to finish reading before I exploded! Yup, that&#8217;s what it did to me. I&#8217;m giving y&#8217;all Too Much Information but I&#8217;m sorry, it just&#8230;.. I can&#8217;t even come up with the words. My mind just poofed~ Those scenes just sucked every rational thought out of my head and left me feeling naughty and needy. Tsk tsk tsk~ I can&#8217;t believe it you know. I&#8217;m still reeling. Even after my shower. *sighs*Moving on, Loved the secondary characters of brother in arms at the camp along with the wife and little girl of a brother in arms there. How the story ended was great. I wasn&#8217;t sure how the author was going to pull it off because it was so complicated! Especally with Ro&#8217;s determination to reunite with her family and the dangers that lurked outside the camp walls. But the ending was good, they got a HEA and I was happy. All was good, I didn&#8217;t care what happen next because they were good and that was all that mattered. Apocalypse be damned.Then I read the epilogue. It stared off good because I really wanted an answer to a surprising situation and then, I didn&#8217;t get it but I wish I hadn&#8217;t read it. It just left me hanging with lots of questions and I wasn&#8217;t sure if the author was going to have a sequel or something, but I was already hoping for a sequel for the rest of the other hunky brothers in arms so that they could each find their own HEAs, but no. It just got messed up and Ugh~ So frustrated! I loved it so much and then, Bam! *sighs*I loved it though. Despite the epilogue which I loved and hated, I still recommend this. Like really highly recommend this.This lovely ARC was provided by the author for a honest review.Rating: 5 out of 5", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A must read debut for erotica readers!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1404172800, "reviewTime": "07 1, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A2YCBO2Q31LYD7", "asin": "B00LBHITPE", "reviewerName": "OPV", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "Wheat Free Gourmet Desserts is a great collection of recipes that are much healthier and delicious.

I love this author's books and have read nearly all of her books and I've read this series and enjoyed it. This book was a complete miss for me. The love story just wasn't realistic and I don't believe that mature adults, particularly the H, would behave like this. The H is a high school principal and we know him from the other books as he is a close friend of the family of all the other main characters. The h was an art teacher before a horrific car accident injured her badly. Now she works on websites. The H is set up with the h by Maggie, another character we know from the previous books, who finds the h on an online dating website. Maggie starts writing to the h and then connects the H and h with each other. The problem is that the photo the H has of the h was taken before the accident and she had long blonde hair, blue eyes and was much thinner. After the accident she is badly scarred on her face and leg, she has brown contacts and has died her hair black and cut it. They begin corresponding and the H falls for the h. He decides to push her into meeting him by arranging to visit her much sooner than she planned. She wanted to have one more op on her face, change her contacts, dye her hair and lose weight. She concocts a scheme to go and meet him before he comes to see her. Sounds good? I thought so.+++Spoilers+++The H was so superficial and fell in love with the h's picture. The h hadn't used her real name on the website and so when he met her as her true self, he had no idea who she was. The h was too scared to tell him the truth and his interaction with her as her other persona just complicated an already messy story. The fact that the h never tells the H the truth during her week long stay had me wanting to throw my Kindle several times.

But I changed my mind while reading the story. They are both to blame for what happened.I feel that Payton and Noah were probably more in love than loving each other. Why else would Payton belittle Noah for his choices without feeling any remorse, any guilt? Why else would Noah cheat on Payton? Payton never asked, had never wondered, never saw the problems Noah was battling. He felt superior to Noah because Noah went out clubbing, while Payton himself stayed at home and studied. And still Noah had better results, but even that Payton did not acknowledged.Then we meet the two men some years later. Payton continues pretty much the same way he had left off. He is quite self-righteous, still not listening. Even his best friend Adam who had supported him \"back then\" is not quite on \"his side\" now. Of course, it is partly because he knows more than Payton, but probably also because he judges Payton as stuck in old patterns. Noah has served his time. He had messed up his life very seriously, but he had come through, damaged but living. I cried for him, for them.The story shows that changing is doable, if you add some will to it.

He won the concert and had the passes sent to Emily&#8217;s. Only problem&#8230; he wasn&#8217;t returning any of her calls, clearly done with the entire relationship. But she tried to contact him over and over to no avail. So she went to the show. This was going to be a new experience for her. She had never been to a rock concert. She had no idea what to expect.But everything she thought she was expecting turned into so much more when she ended up on the tour bus after spending a lot of time with Mike&#8217;s brother behind the scenes. When she finally met Mike, she decided that she was going to cut loose a little. Live a little, rock a little&#8230; She had taken time off from her job and this was her chance to get out there and experience life.I am not sure she was expecting what she got herself into, but once she was there, she knew she was going to take advantage of the situation she found herself in. Mike and Emily became fast friends, in and outside of the bedroom. But could there be potential for anything more there? Could she forget how much she loved Nate and just move on? Could Mike change who he was and want anything more than a fling with Emily? And what about the rest of the band? How will they react to their new traveling companion?This book was just amazing. It had fun twists and turns and new binds at every turn, but it was so much more than that. It was a great journey of self discovery. Emily finally had the chance to step away from her carefully planned life and find out who she really was. What she wanted out of life and she found the courage and determination to follow through with what she wanted and she found the strength to find love all over again.I will admit, I was a little nervous at the beginning when I found out that this would all be written in the language of the locale. I thought that it would be a bit distracting as I usually have to pause and remember where an author lives when words aren&#8217;t spelled the same and there are new twists on phrases that I am used to hearing. It typically makes me take pause when I come to words like realise and pyjamas and cute phrases that we say in everyday life, &#8220;He looked like a million pounds.&#8221; Now for those across the ocean these are normal words and phrases. But it worked really well in this book, because the scene was set in the location of the language. I actually grew really fond of it in this book. It doesn&#8217;t work in a lot of books, but in this one it does.This book was hot, it was sweet and it shows the power of friends, faith and staying true to who you are, even if you are rediscovering who you are supposed to be.

The blurb certainly will!!  I added this book to my TBR faster than you can say 'yes please'.  The first few pages of this book set the mood for the rest of the book.  And I was definitely not disappointed!!  I had a love/hate thing happening in my head about Mr. Sebastian Black.  I found I was drawn to his character and couldn't read enough about him but also repulsed about how he treated the women in his little black book.  I found me throwing my head back and silently laughing about his need to name 'his girls' cartoon characters.  For instance, he's with Wilma and Betty as the book begins.  Funny, right?!  Every girl in his book is a different name.  Jessica Rabbit is one name that will remain unused.  All until Rosslyn Harris walks into his club.&#34;Because deal or no deal, you're my Jessica... I most definitely do not call anyone else Jessica.  Only you and for a special reason.&#34;The writing is witty and classic.  Classic in the sense that we will be talking about this book for a very.  Long.  Time.  As I uncovered more and more layers of Sebastian, I found myself unable to continue the love/hate and became captivated by his charm.  As did our heroine, Rosslyn, Roz.&#34;I was shaking again, but I wasn't sure if it was my nerves or the sensations that were flying through my body at light speed.  I was losing myself in him and it had only been a matter of minutes since we'd stepped into the room.&#34;Roz is a 22 year-old virgin.  I know!  I know!  But just go with it.  I find that many authors use this... template, for lack of a better description.  And it works but I always find flaws.  The young innocent falls to the alpha without thinking twice.  But here... well you're in for a REAL treat! After propositioned from Sebastian, Roz doesn't immediately fall at his feet.  And she doesn't play the 'I'm just curious' card either.  Although she is... immensely curious.  Roz and her brother have just lost her grandmother.  And she's been left to care for her younger brother, Kyle.  So she doesn't make this choice to accept Sebastian lightly.  Only after she exhausted other avenues and find herself without a roof over her head and living with Kyle in their car.&#34;I'd failed Kyle... and there was nothing I could do to make it right.&#34;It's raw and gripping.  It works so poetically in this book.  This is made that much harder on her with the tragedy we discover that happened 12 years earlier.  More and more pieces of that puzzle evolve like the wings of a butterfly coming from its' chrysalis.  It's beautifully written.  Much care has been taken to be sure - in every way - that the reader falls for each of them.  Each of their problems and conflicts I wished to shoulder for them.  The evolvement of their relationship is unique.  And not insta-love.  It progresses in an intricate, yet effortless, way.&#34;I'm almost there with you - so close it scares the s#*t out of me.  I want to know your name, but I'm still afraid that I'll run when you tell me and running from you is the last thing I want to do.&#34;The book is told in dual POV!  And transitions between the two flawlessly.  This book has some great secondary characters.  The truly had parts to play.  They weren't just taking up space!  There are dark, twisty moment.  There are sexy, fierce moments. And the chemistry is explosive between Roz and Sebastian.  But there is never a moment that you want to quit swiping pages.  Never a time with valleys.  Only peaks!

Either the stories are so similiar you start to get the idea you are reading the same story with the names changed to protect the authors, or there are a couple good stories and the rest are filler.  That is NOT the case with Summer Nights.  Each author has a different voice and a unique way to bring their characters alive.  Every story had it's share of drama and humor.  These are all very good novellas.  And there's only one thing I hate about good novellas, they leave me starving for more.  More story, more character development, more \"what happens next?\".  Every one of these stories left me wanting more.  So if you are in love with historical romance and looking for some new authors to add to your favorites, start looking here.

I stayed up until the wee hours of the night reading this! It was that good. It's not perfect, but it sure was entertaining and I am crazy for book 2 at the moment.Tessa was a very forgiving (it become annoying how forgiving she was by the second half of the book), would-die-for-a-normal-life girl. The problem is she has to wear gloves/cover her skin at all times because every time someone touches her she has visions/reads emotions and it really takes a toll. That's probably why she tries so hard to fit in with a clique that has nothing to do with her interests and due to peer pressure decides to drink a shot of tequila at a party (P.S. She had never drunk alcohol before this).Dastien was the hero. Tessa's and his relationship was also insta-love and just for that the book became your typical love triangle werewolf story.&#34;The spark was Fourth of July-sized with Dastien.&#34;It was a turn-off, but the story (apart from that) was pretty creative and well written so I continued on. Dastien is the all around nice guy with an ahhhmazing body and has an actual brain that functions. What I hated about him when he was introduced was that he ignored her and glued himself to Queen Bitch (Imogene - Even her name sounds Queeny to me -shudders-). Sure, we later found out it was at her parents request to give her &#34;space&#34;, but all it did was add unnecessary drama to a very good action story.I will admit that I was Team Chris in the beginning. Especially since I imagined him as Liam Hemsworth....Dreamy -sigh-.&#34;Chris was nice and funny and easy to be around and also hot.&#34;He was there for her in the beginning unlike Mr. Insta-love.Meredith is the BFF I will always want to have. She's caring, understanding and is always on your side. No. Matter. What. & Best of all she wasn't plotting to take Dastien away from Tessa, unlike Shannon.The ending was nice. Sure, a little predictable and finished WAY too fast, but nice. If it were any other author she would have stopped the book with the kidnapping and leave everyone hanging. You know what? I respect Mrs. Erin because she didn't do that. She knows there are a lot of subplots to be resolved in the story still and she can always integrate another big bang at the end of book two. So it's a win-win.Favorite Quotes:&#34;Yes.

Will Cruz ever get to tell her how he truly feels?&#34;I once said to her that if she just wanted to be friends then I would have to live with that, but I wouldn't live without her in my life.&#34;In this continuing story, we find Cruz watching the love of his life fighting to come back to him.

She has lost some of her memory and in that memory was her love for Cruz. *enter tears* She doesn't remember the past year and their love for each other. By 8% into this book, I was in tears. Like serious tears! Cruz broke my heart! Ok, more like shattered it into a million pieces. His love for Harlow was so strong and she couldn't give the same to him.

I like to think that after reading my reviews, Courtney said! &#8220;Okay Derna just for you I will write Brand&#8217; s story. LOL! Brand was one of those secondary characters that left their mark on me, there was just something about him, he really was a good friend, a good soldier, a good everything, and he was so worthy of his own book as I wanted to know more about him and his story.In Until We Fly we learn Brand&#8217;s backstory, what makes him the way he is. We discover his pain, his secrets and demons from a harrowing childhood that he wants to forget that he has learnt to deal with, but they still that haunts him. I just love this man even more now so sexy, so loyal, so protected a true hero, and just a nice guy with the biggest heart.Nora Greene is the girl from his past, who has always had a thing for on Brand. I didn&#8217;t know what to make of her at first, but as her story unfolded, and I discover her pain and her secrets, I understood her more, she may come across as confidence you could see she had her insecurities, there was a vulnerability about her. I love her brazen attitude she knew what she wanted, and she wanted Brand. Something you have to take the bull by the horn, and just go for what you want, and Nora didBrand and Nora are two people who have issues, who have parents who were never going to win parents of the year award, who have demons to deal with, but work well together, have a connection, have great chemistry, and soon realize that they need each other in order to heal and move forward.Once again in true Courtney style she as has written a book that comes from the heart. I love how she always manages to take me on an emotional roller coaster. I loved drama, pain, angst, and the twist and turns that I never saw coming that Brand and Nora go through, but also the steam, love, hope, passion forgiveness and romance that they share. I was hooked right till the end, and I love the sweet epilogue.If you love books that pull at your heartstrings then this one, and the rest of the Beautiful Broken series is for you.

I love my alpha males and so far I am not disappointed.  Starting with Sienna Mynx book Rallenti...whew lord Renaldo, is one intense, hot, pure 100% bonafide sexy ass alpha man walking! I loved the story and I loved the chemistry between Kyra and Renaldo as well as the HOT love scenes.  If you are not familiar with the Battaglia series, get familiar with it!  If you loved this book by Ms. Mynx, purchase the entire Battaglia series! If you want more of tall, good looking alpha men, sink your teeth into Giovanni, Lorenzo and Carlo of the Battagila series. You wont be disappointed!!! As always Ms. Mynx outstanding!!!!Now, let me talk about my Navy Seals that Aliyah Burke writes about.  If your not familiar with the Megalodon series, get familiar with it.  You will not be disappointed. (Tyson and his hazel eyes is my favorite Seal) Although Reeve is not a Seal, he is an alpha man that can handle himself.  Affrika is independent, talented and very attracted to Reeves, the brother of one of the Seals.  Reeve is rich, spoiled and determined to have Affrika.  The chemistry between the two is intense while the story is intriguing and draws you into some of the realities that actual happen around the world.  Love, betrayal, family and trust makes this book a definite winner!!I just finished reading Pepper Pace's book, Everything is Everything and let me tell you, it is excellent!! The story is well written and told in so much depth and detail that it brought back so many memories that I had growing up when I to had once lived up a hill a few streets away from the projects.  This story draws you into the lives of the each person.  What they faced growing up in the area that they did, how they handled it and how they survived it.  I am looking forward the the next installment of this book where lies are revealed, truth is discovered and relationships are more than likely broken beyond repair.  Well done Ms. Pace!!!Tiana Laveen's Tattooed Moon is yet another well written phenomenal book by this author.  Julien and Milan are somewhat like kindred spirits who are drawn to each other by their similar hurts as well as their vast differences.  Julien isn't the normal alpha male that you would expect, but, he is just that as well as having many other attributes that make you look at him much deeper than what is tattooed on his outside skin. Milan saw that, a lot of people normally would not.  The story between the two is an awe inspiring love story that will make you think, truly think about how you perceive people on the outside.  Not everyone that is smiling on the outside is not crying internally.  Milan and Julien are each other's medicine, which cured them both of what they have lost and what they were missing.  Well done Ms. Laveen!!Latrivia Nelson's Vasily's Revenge has me definitely wanting more.  Although this is not the first book that I have read from this author, this was the first book in the Medlov series that I have read and now, I need to go back to the beginning starting with Dimitry!! I am hooked!! Vasily love's Lily, he wants to protect her but doesn't know if he can trust her.  Lies, deceit and unanswered questions swirl around Vasily, Lily, Dylan and other's.  I will be looking for the sequel in November!  I can't wait to delve further into the Medlov series!!Erosa Knowles and the twins Donnie and Blaine lord yes I will take both of them please!!!  I love this series and I am soooo  glad that I did not have to start at the beginning to find out about the twins personalities.  Yes, very dominant, very alpha and very fine men who take control of Belinda who cannot and will not separate the two of them.  I enjoyed this read immensely and I am glad that it intertwined with the character's so well.  The chemistry between Donald, Blaine and Belinda was definitely on fire along with the love that they each have for each other and their twin boys.  If you have not read the Men of 3X Construction series, get it and read about these alpha men who definitely make their presence known! Well done Ms. Knowels.Bridget Midway's book was definitely worth the read.  I read this book a while back and enjoyed it.  I definitely enjoyed the updated version of the book even better.  The Dom in Keys(Tank) was shown a lot which I thoroughly enjoyed!  Eminance was still a little annoying to me by jumping to conclusions before finding out the true answers but, so had Keys jumped to conclusions as well.  I was glad that this version had Eminance taking the leap of faith and fulfilling her career as well as her desire to have Keys in her life.  The author delved into personal issues which held each person back for one reason or another. But although time may not heal all wounds, talking and listening completely will help.  Well done Ms. Midway!!Serenity King's Michael's Wrath had me wanting to knock on his door!!!  I love the Alesi series and these strong Alpha men!!!  Michael is no joke!  He knows what he wants regardless of who may have an objection to it and conquers it.  The attraction is immediate with Michael and Kendra and yes the love scenes are HOT!!!  But, there definitely is mystery surrounding Kendra, I'm not sure of what it is but I can't wait to find out! Ms. King, don't make us wait to long!! Well done.Sieged by Rym was really good.  Rym and Krysteena's chemistry was in tune with what one would have with their mate, complete.  It was interesting to read about to Alpha's one being a female.

That was twelve years ago and this is now. He is working at the Lucy Ambrose Centre for Excellence. The local hospital where Ali is contracted to do some work with a training program and she has specified that he be the Doctor to help her.Both Randy and Ali are still harboring attraction for one another and it does not take long for things to heat up in the bedroom once again.

But in the discovery period they can certainly have a lot of fun. They experiment with motorcycle rides, picnics and chocolate sauce.This is a story whose character you will recognize and it is good to be back in touch with them again.

A new series has come to town!!Excellent paranormal book with simple yet effective world building- just what the doctor ordered! Charlie Cochet, your hard work has paid off. This was very enjoyable, though I almost knocked it down to 3.5 stars because the mystery element was weak.In a lot of paranormal books the reader has to do a lot of hard work getting up to speed with the author's created &#34;world.&#34; There is often either an info dump or things aren't very well explained, both of which are pet peeves of mine. This was surprisingly simple and easily digestible world building. If you read the blurb and were a bit confused, here is what you need to know: Therian= Shifter. That's about it. The rest is easy peasy, just some details about how the world got that way and some other basics. I liked the care that the author put into the THIRDS world. Everything was well conceptualized and nicely executed.And the MCs?! *fans self* I loved Dex and Sloane and the chemistry between them. It was all very alpha male, very testosterone-y, and smoking hot. I could have used a wee bit more dirty talk, but I have a weakness for a dirty mouthed boy.Charlie Cochet also created side characters with a TON of meat on their bones... and I don't mean in the chubby-chaser kind of way. There is so much depth to them! I could see this series going on and on. Who DIDN'T feel the chemistry between Ash and Cael and between Calvin and Hobbs (yup, you read that correctly)?? There is a LOT to work with there and I can't wait to read those stories.And the writing... so tight! It had an excellent flow and pace, never getting boring or dull.Now on to the bad... The mystery. *wince* That was a blunder if I'd ever saw one. If you are going to make a bad guy, at least hide him better, Captain Obvious. If I'm going to read romantic suspense, or a mystery, I want to be more clueless. I think this author has to work on her red herring skills (PLEASE!).If I'm going to nit pick, there was also a ton of back and forth between Sloane and Dex that grew a bit tiresome.

But I also really enjoyed Kaylee Ryan's writing style and I loved all the characters.When Tatum Thompson loses both of her parents in a tragic car accident she turns to her boyfriend, only to find him with another girl. Her best friend Leah and Leah's fiance Brent offer to let her move with them from Ohio to Tennessee and stay with them for as long as she wants to get a fresh start. She decides to move with them and Brent gets her a job interview with the mayor's office to work in her field of marketing and PR. She ends up meeting Blaise Richards the receptionist's son. They are both instantly attracted to each other and feel a connection neither of them have ever felt before. Tatum is determined to stay away from guys after what she just went through with Josh, but Blaise isn't willing to give up so easily. Blaise has kept things casual since his ex cheated on him, but he knows that what he feels for Tatum is so much more than just a good time. Can Blaise show Tatum that he is worthy of her trust and that they belong together? Can Tatum open herself up again and take a chance on forever with Blaise?I really can't say enough great things about Blaise, but I loved and adored him. He was sweet and kind, patient and understanding. He was so great with everyone in his family and his friends, and he was so good for Tatum. He let her take her time and do things on her terms, but he was always there for her. He was supportive and encouraging, and I loved that he took things slow with her. He wanted all of her and he didn't want to be with her physically until she was able to commit to him, which I thought just made him that much better of a book boyfriend. He cared so much about her, and even though their feelings developed quickly they just felt so real and believable. Tatum was great also, and I liked seeing her find Blaise and see what a real man is like. She had been used to a relationship that while not awful at first wasn't great either. It was nice to see her cooking and playing games with Blaise and his family, and really starting to let others in besides Leah and Brent. She had so much healing to do, and I felt like Blaise and his family were exactly what she needed. Their relationship was so sweet, and I really felt like they were perfect for each other in every way. I loved the chemistry and attraction between them, but I also loved the emotional connection that they were forming as well.Overall, I really felt that this book was fantastic. I read this cover to cover because I couldn't put it down. I loved everything about the story and the characters, and I really liked how everyone fit together. This group of friends and family were so much fun to read about, and I loved the connection that they had to each other. I will say that this one was really sweet sometimes bordering on cheesy and the feelings happened quickly, and for some it might be too unrealistic to get behind. But honestly for me, I really was enjoying the story and characters so much that it didn't even matter to me and I felt like it worked. I would highly recommend this book to romance fans of all genres, and I think that these characters will be so easy for readers to relate to and become invested in. If you are looking for a sweet HEA with a sexy tattooed hero and a strong and likable heroine, you should definitely give this one a shot.

She knows she needs to leave her past behind, but it's easier said than done. Thankfully, she has a good support system in her best friend and her boyfriend and decides to start anew by moving with them to another town. Once there, she's lucky enough to find a job that she loves and meets the one man that will change her life for the best.Blaise has been burned before so he doesn't do relationships anymore. His focus is volunteering as a firefighter (*swoon*), managing his tattoo parlor (*sigh*) and his family (*melt*). But from the moment he meets Tatum, he can't think of nothing else. Drawn by the pain behind her eyes and her easy manner, Blaise tries to deny that he has found his one.I loved this story!Kaylee Ryan didn't pull any punches drawing me into the story. From the very beginning I was emotionally invested in Tatum's story. I felt her pain and cried right along with her when her world shattered into a million pieces. I admired her determination to move on with her life and the way she went about her attraction to Blaise.Tatum and Blaise's connection was immediate and their chemistry easily palpable, but what I enjoyed the most were their honest interactions, the tender touches and their conflicted emotions regarding what was developing between them. I loved that they questioned, analyzed and pondered what laid behind their connection. Yes, they had an insta-love kind of relationship, but the author went to great lengths to back that up with plenty dialogue too so that when the time came for them to be together, I didn't for a moment doubt their feelings.Along with the sizzling chemistry there was also a great range in emotions. From Tatum's pain in losing her parents and being betrayed to her excitement in starting in a new town all the way through Blaise's affection towards Tatum and the thrill he felt at pursuing her, Kaylee Ryan brought it all to the page in a way that helped me connect to both characters. I found myself cheering them on, even if I wanted to shake some sense into them a time or two.All in all, an emotional but sweet romantic read with lots of funny and steamy moments to round it all up!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "An emotional but sweet romantic read.", "unixReviewTime": 1405296000, "reviewTime": "07 14, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A30W4TBLELNZBM", "asin": "B00LLI4V82", "reviewerName": "Tina Harris", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "4 starsThis book was an easy read with a great message of what happens when life kicks you to the ground, you have to pick yourself back up and live again no matter how much you want to give up.  Even in the worst of times, there is always a silver lining.  True love will knock you off your feet.Tatum Thompson is happy.  She lives with her parents, finishing her major in what she loves and has a boyfriend who loves her.  But when life decides to turn Tatum&#8217;s world upside down she believes she will never love or trust again.  She only needs her best friend, Leah.  When Leah suggest that Tatum move with her to Tennessee, a fresh start will be exactly what she needs.Blaise Richards seems to have it all co-owner of a tattoo shop with his twin brother, volunteer firefighter and loving family.  But there is one part that is lacking that is in his love life.  He thought he had found the perfect one with Beth but she crushed his heart by cheating on him.  He has since just had casual nights here and there.  Blaise still had dreams of having that forever with someone.When Blaise and Tatum&#8217;s world collide in morning things seems to get better from that day for both of them.  They have this instant chemistry but are both wary of falling to fast.  Well that is until Blaise decides Tatum is his &#8220;One&#8221;.  He can not imagine the thought of someone else with her.

She needs him.Finally all seems to be going wonderfully for Tatum and Blaise until there is another accident.  Will this leave one of them without their true love?This was my first book by author Kaylee Rynn.  I enjoyed the story that she told with these characters.  Tatum and Leah&#8217;s relationship was exactly what best friends should be.  Blaise and his family is also what everyone wishes their families were like.  And the underlying story broke my heart a few times, shed a tear or two and yelled at Tatum to stop fighting her attract and just jump Blaise.

Thanks to K.M. Weiland, the classic Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte is now a part of that collection.If you&#8217;ve never read Jane Eyre, I suggest reading it before picking up this annotated edition. Mainly because it is a great book, but also because, if you&#8217;re anything like me, you&#8217;ll get so swept up in the story you&#8217;ll bypass the notes. I&#8217;d never read Jane Eyre before. But, when the opportunity presented itself to read this, I decided it was time. So, I read the book, then I went back through and read the annotations by K.M. Weiland.Understanding structure and how a novel progresses can be a difficult thing sometimes. With the annotated version of Jane Eyre, K.M. Weiland makes it easy to see where in the story the key factors to make a great story take place. She explains the hook, setting, conflict, tension, using all five senses, closing chapters, and symbolism and theme to name a few. And it&#8217;s not just, &#8220;Hey, this is where this happens.&#8221; It&#8217;s a detailed description of how Bronte used these aspects of writing to better her story.This is one of the few writing advice books I would recommend, not because it gives advice, but because it helps you to understand how you can make your story really shine by offering examples.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Useful and informative", "unixReviewTime": 1405728000, "reviewTime": "07 19, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A1R0DR1A8WF0SS", "asin": "B00LLOT7QW", "reviewerName": "CKFashant", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "Calling Eli Jackson the &#34;shy&#34; Jackson brother is not a difficult stretch, considering how loud and boisterous his two older brothers are.  But there is something more reserved and cautious about Eli that &#34;shy&#34; doesn't even begin to cover.  So when Cutter and Calder gift Eli a &#34;honeymoon&#34; trip to a gaming convention with his &#34;game wife&#34;, Eli is not thrilled.  After finding out his &#34;wife&#34; is outgoing and sexy, he is ready to call the whole thing off.Zoey Daniels lives life in the moment.  She touches everyone she meets, both literally and figuratively.  When she is invited to spend a weekend at a gaming convention with the man she has been gaming with for two years, but has never met, she jumps in with both feet.  Now she finds herself falling hard for a man who has cut himself off from the world, and happiness in general.  Can she touch him deep enough to make a difference and open him up to the possibilities of life?This one started out very fun and light-hearted.  There was a lot of back and forth bantering that actually does happen when gamers congregate (I know because I am married to one and have hosted my share of game nights).  I loved the brotherly interaction as well.  Ironically, that is another one I have first hand knowledge of.The light-heartedness turned a little emotional toward the middle though, with both characters discovering each other's challenges.  The way those challenges were dealt with were very really.  I didn't feel cheated, as though the author was trying to find an easy fix to some major issues.  The reactions were raw and well timed, and the resolution was fun, but with that little bit of brevity that makes it special.As always, I need to consider the supporting characters.  The only real supporting characters in this book were the brothers.  And their antics were both fun and endearing.  They obviously love their little brother and are genuinely worried about him, but they also like to take the mickey out of him...a lot.Overall, this was an awesome and insightful story that will have readers admitting that they might just be gamers at heart.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "and happiness in general", "unixReviewTime": 1404864000, "reviewTime": "07 9, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A2P8NU1PMGRI5A", "asin": "B00LLQTCEC", "reviewerName": "sue", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "Wow wow wow.

Yes, I was always tolerant of M/M etc. relationships, but did not really understand to what degree love is the same for all couples. We love a partner that fulfills, encourages, instills pride, and takes our breath away. Gender does not matter, it is the connection we feel for each other that matters. In addition, what is most important in a successful relationship is trust. That is the crux of this book. Logan and Tate have to build this trust in each other in order for them to get closer and leave the past behind.Did you ever wonder what the impact would be on those around this couple? How will their families react? Their business associates? Acceptance is a word used and flaunted every day, but what does it take to really accept the intimate relationship of two men in our society?

I love everything about this story.  I love Zeth and Sloane.  I love the connection that they have.  This story showed Zeth&#8217;s softer side if you can imagine him having one.  His love for Sloane was so strong and undeniable.  He even allowed himself to be vulnerable.  I enjoyed this nice change in him.  Don&#8217;t even get me started about Zeth drinking tea with Sloane&#8217;s parents.  Hilarious. Sloane had some soul searching to do of her own.  What she was willing to give up to be part of Zeth&#8217;s world.  I know Zeth and Sloane are supposed to be the main characters but really this story would not work as well without all the supporting cast that add so much.  Lacey is always a delight and is slowly gaining her confidence back and somehow becoming the voice of reason.  Even the bad guys are just the most awesome violent bad guys.  There are so many layers to this story and I cannot wait to see where it continues.  It has been a great ride since book one and it continues to be fun and action filled.

In the process she was responsible for the dead and wounded within the base.Marquez was also the commander of the base and he feels responsible for the deaths. He felt there was something he could have done to prevent it. Of course there wasn't but no one not his brothers Drae or Cam or anyone else can say anything to convince him otherwise. Its a demon he lives with every day.Being commander weighed heavily on Marquez. Something his brothers thought but never knew for sure until Marquez was so badly wounded.They both learned how badly it ate at him when he had to write letters of condolence to the families of those who were killed when sent out on missions. Men he sent out. How he felt personally resonsible for those deaths. Being commander was one tough row to hoe for Marquez. He wished he'd been able to refuse the promotion that made him commander but according to his commanding officer he was the best man for the job. Duty.

From his mom.Julian's personal weakness is that he's a nice guy. And Dragons aren't nice. At all. It's pissed off his mother and caused him problems.But he has decided to embrace being nice. Rachel Aaron has bucked the classic hero prototype that heroes are generally a nice guy because that's their default setting. Instead being a decent person (dragon, whatever) is a burden to overcome. It's a fun twist to make the nice guy thing a disadvantage that he can use to against his foes.Several characters, especially the quirky dragon seer, Bob, are wonderful. Marci, the mage, is not just a paper cutout female to compliment the protagonist, but is a strong co-protagonist, perfectly willing to kill, while Julian, the dragon is more squeamish about taking life. And Ghost the Dead Cat is quite terrible in an interesting way.There are lots of references to pop fantasy culture things to find.

It&#8217;s about a young girl&#8217;s journey to find out the truth about her hero and learning to accept whatever information is learned.It&#8217;s a beautifully written story with well developed main characters that readers can&#8217;t help but root for as they try to figure out if and how they can be back in each other&#8217;s lives after all of the lies and pain they have caused each other.  Brooke does a great job of showing how deeply both Ceci and Bentley were affected by their break up and then illustrates their attempts at reconnecting through not only their words but also the sexual intimacy that has always allowed them to completely express their feelings for one another.The Intern is one of my favorite serials out there!
